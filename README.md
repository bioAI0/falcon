Falcon hackathon

sorry its very disorganized

esm3 has all my experiments
sorry i didn't save the prompts

the code is super simple and is in test-ai71
it just calls the ai71 endpoint
the magic is in the data 

the real thing i want to show is not the code
not the prompt
but that there is this vast resource of knowledge
of content
that is just waiting to be explored and exploited(?)
there are so many science papers out there
like so so many
and they just keep coming out!
and faster than ever!
we just have to mine these for value
and then put it up on the web
as content

i think the 
jinghu glycine meme on tiktok
fully illustrates this

oh right i wrote a tiny bit of code to 
turn text into speech with openai
but that is super simple as well
