 The reference [81] is a citation to a research paper titled "Attention is not all you need: Pure attention loses rank doubly exponentially with depth" by Yihe Dong, Jean-Baptiste Cordonnier, and Andreas Loukas. The paper discusses the limitations of using pure attention mechanisms in deep neural networks, which is relevant to the field of Evolutionary Scale Modelling (ESM) because ESM often involves the use of deep neural networks to model complex biological systems.
