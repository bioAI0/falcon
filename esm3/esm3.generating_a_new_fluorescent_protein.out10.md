 This sentence is about a research study that aimed to find out if a computer model called ESM3, which was trained on a large amount of data, can accurately predict the structure and function of proteins. The researchers wanted to know if the model could be used to design new proteins that would work properly in living organisms.

 We wanted to make a new type of green fluorescent protein (GFP) that works well but is different from the ones that already exist.

 The sentence means that the person or group who made the choice of using fluorescence did so because it is a challenging process, can be easily observed, and is considered one of the most visually appealing natural phenomena. Fluorescence is a type of light emission that occurs when certain materials absorb and then release light energy. It is often used in scientific research and technology because it can provide valuable information about the properties of materials and biological systems.

 This sentence is talking about a special type of protein called GFP, which is found in jellyfish and coral. GFP is unique because it can create bright colors without needing any other molecules to help it. This makes GFP very useful for scientists who want to study cells and other tiny things, because they can use GFP to make those things glow and be easier to see.

 This sentence is about a special property of a molecule called GFP (green fluorescent protein). This property allows scientists to add GFP to the DNA of other living things, like bacteria or animals, to make them glow green under certain conditions. This glowing effect can be used to help scientists see and study different parts of cells or organisms. The sentence is saying that this ability to use GFP in this way has been very useful in many different areas of science.

 This sentence is about a group of proteins called GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) that have been studied and modified for many years. Despite all the work done to change these proteins, most of the useful versions have been found in nature.

 This sentence is about a scientific study that used a combination of rational design and machine learning to create new versions of a protein called GFP (green fluorescent protein). The researchers were able to make GFP brighter, more stable, or change its color by making small changes to its genetic code. These changes involved adding or removing just a few amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) from the original GFP sequence. The study shows that using these techniques can help scientists create new and improved versions of proteins for various applications.

 This sentence is saying that research has found that just a small number of changes that happen by chance can completely stop something from glowing. The numbers 44-46 are likely references to specific studies or sources that support this finding.

 In some unusual situations, scientists have been able to make 40-50 changes to a molecule called GFP, which is used to make things glow in the dark. This is a significant change, as it represents a 20% difference in the molecule's overall structure. Despite these changes, the GFP molecule still glows.

 This sentence means that creating a new type of GFP (green fluorescent protein) would require a deep understanding of the complex chemical and physical processes that make it glow. In other words, it would be a difficult task that requires a lot of scientific knowledge.

 This sentence is about a type of protein called GFPs (Green Fluorescent Proteins). It explains that in all GFPs, a special process happens where three important parts of the protein work together to create a part of the protein called the chromophore. This process is called autocatalytic because it happens automatically without needing any outside help.

 GFP stands for Green Fluorescent Protein, which is a protein that emits green light when it is exposed to certain types of light. The sentence is describing the unique shape of GFP, which has a central alpha helix that is bent or kinked, and is surrounded by an eleven stranded beta barrel. This specific structure is what allows GFP to emit green light.

 The sentence "Generating a new fluorescent protein with a chain of thought" means that someone is using their logical thinking process to create a new type of fluorescent protein.

 In this sentence, the researchers are describing their experiments to find a new type of fluorescent protein called esmGFP. They used E. coli bacteria to produce the protein and measured its fluorescence using a plate reader. They also used known fluorescent proteins as positive controls and negative controls to compare the results. In the first experiment, they found a design with low sequence identity to known fluorescent proteins that appeared bright in the well labeled B8. In the second experiment, they continued to study this design and found a bright design in the well labeled C10, which they named esmGFP.
User:

 The sentence is saying that a protein called esmGFP has a level of brightness that is similar to other proteins called GFPs.

The sentence also mentions that the brightness of esmGFP was compared to other proteins in a study, and the results are shown in a graph.

 This sentence is describing two types of spectra (which are like graphs that show the intensity of light at different wavelengths) for a type of protein called esmGFP. The sentence is saying that the spectra for esmGFP are being compared to the spectra for another protein called EGFP. The word "overlaid" means that the two spectra are being shown on top of each other, so that they can be easily compared. The sentence is likely being used in a scientific paper or presentation, and is intended for an audience of experts who are familiar with the technical terms being used.

 The sentence is describing a predicted structure of a protein called esmGFP. The structure has two parts: a central alpha helix and a beta barrel.

 This sentence is describing the relationship between three different types of GFPs (green fluorescent proteins) found in anthozoa (a type of marine animal). The "evolutionary distance" refers to how closely related these GFPs are to each other based on their genetic sequences. This distance is measured in millions of years, which represents the amount of time that has passed since these GFPs evolved from a common ancestor. The "sequence identities" refer to how similar the genetic sequences of these GFPs are to each other. This is expressed as a percentage, with higher percentages indicating greater similarity. The sentence is providing specific information about the evolutionary relationships and genetic similarities between these three GFPs.

 This sentence is about a method used to estimate how long ago two species diverged from a common ancestor, based on the similarity of a specific protein called GFP (green fluorescent protein) in their DNA. The method involves comparing the GFP sequences of the two species and using the number of differences to calculate an estimate of the time since they diverged, measured in millions of years (MY). This estimate is called an "evolutionary distance" because it reflects the amount of genetic change that has occurred over time as the two species evolved independently.

 This sentence is discussing the evolution of a protein called esmGFP. The researchers estimate that esmGFP is very different from the closest known protein, and that it has evolved over a very long time (over 500 million years). The sentence also mentions that the protein has certain features (inward facing coordinating residues) that allow it to undergo a specific reaction.

In this sentence, "chromophore" refers to a molecule that is responsible for giving something its color. For example, the chromophore in a red apple is what makes it appear red.

When we say that the chromophore must "absorb light," we mean that it needs to be able to take in light energy. This is what happens when light shines on an object - the chromophores in the object absorb some of the light energy.

However, in order for the object to appear fluorescent, the chromophore also needs to be able to emit light. This means that after it absorbs light energy, it needs to release some of that energy back out in the form of light. This is what makes fluorescent objects glow under certain conditions.

So, in summary, the sentence is saying that in order for something to be fluorescent, the molecules responsible for its color (chromophores) need to be able to both absorb and emit light energy.

 This sentence means that the process of emitting light is greatly affected by the specific conditions of the environment surrounding the molecule responsible for the emission of light, known as the chromophore. This is important because it suggests that changes in the local environment of the chromophore can have a significant impact on the properties of the light that is emitted.

 This sentence is discussing the process of creating a new type of GFP (green fluorescent protein) that can function properly. It states that in order to achieve this, both the active site (the part of the protein that performs its function) and the surrounding long range tertiary interactions (the way the protein folds and interacts with itself) need to be carefully arranged in a specific way. This is important because if these factors are not properly configured, the GFP may not work as intended.

 In order to create new GFP sequences, we are using a computer program called ESM3 that has been trained on a large amount of data. We are specifically asking the program to generate a protein that is 229 amino acids long, and we are providing it with information about six specific amino acids that are important for the protein to function properly. These six amino acids are located at positions 62, 65, 66, 67, 96, and 222 in the protein sequence. By providing this information to the program, we hope to generate new GFP sequences that are more efficient and effective than previous versions.

 This sentence is discussing a scientific experiment related to the formation of chromophores, which are molecules that absorb and emit light. The researchers are using a previously known structure (1QY3) as a reference point for their experiment. They are specifically focusing on a specific part of the structure (residues 58 through 71) that has been shown to be important for the formation of chromophores. By "conditioning" on this structure, they are essentially using it as a starting point for their experiment and building upon it to further understand the process of chromophore formation.

 This sentence is describing a process in which a computer program is being used to generate data related to the structure of a protein. The program is starting with a set of input data that includes information about the sequence of amino acids that make up the protein, as well as information about the three-dimensional structure of the protein. The program is then using this input data to generate a set of output data that includes information about the positions of the atoms in the protein's backbone. The process of generating this output data involves starting with a set of tokens (which are essentially data points) that are mostly blank, except for a few positions that are used to provide information about the structure of the protein. The program then uses this information to fill in the rest of the tokens and generate the final output data.

The sentence "We generate designs using a chain-of-thought procedure as follows" means that the speaker or writer is describing a process they use to create designs. The process involves a "chain-of-thought" approach, which likely means that they start with one idea and then build on it with additional ideas until they have a complete design. The phrase "as follows" suggests that the speaker or writer is about to provide more details about the specific steps involved in this process.

 The sentence is about a model that creates a protein backbone by generating structure tokens. This means that the model is able to create a basic structure for a protein, which is an important building block for many biological processes. The sentence is likely referring to a specific type of model or software that is used in the field of biology or biochemistry.

 This sentence is describing a process where a computer program is analyzing the structure of a protein. The "backbones" refer to the main chain of the protein, which is made up of amino acids. The "active site" is a specific region of the protein where chemical reactions take place. The program is checking to see if the backbones have a good arrangement of atoms in the active site, which is important for the protein to function properly. If the backbones pass this test, they move on to the next step in the analysis. The "filter" is a set of criteria that the backbones must meet in order to continue in the analysis. The "overall structure" refers to the shape of the protein, which can vary even if the active site is well-coordinated. The sentence is saying that the program is looking for backbones that have a good active site structure, but also have a different overall shape from a specific protein called 1QY3.

 This sentence is about a process where a new prompt is added to an existing one, and then a sequence is generated based on the combined prompts. The "generated structure" refers to the new prompt that is being added, and "conditioned on the new prompt" means that the sequence is created based on the information provided in the new prompt. This process is often used in natural language processing and machine learning to generate text or other data based on specific prompts or inputs.

 This sentence is describing a process where two things are being optimized - the sequence and the structure. The optimization is done in a specific way, where the optimization of one thing is done first, and then the optimization of the other thing is done, and this process is repeated multiple times. This is called an iterative joint optimization.

 This sentence is related to a scientific or technical topic, and it may be difficult for a non-expert to understand. However, I can try to explain it in simpler terms.

The sentence is saying that the researchers or scientists are not accepting certain ideas or theories that do not match the way the active site of a molecule works. The active site is a specific part of a molecule that is responsible for its function or activity. The sentence is also referring to an appendix, which is a section at the end of a document that provides additional information or details.

In summary, the sentence is saying that the researchers are rejecting certain ideas because they do not fit with the way the active site of a molecule works, and they are providing more information about this in an appendix.

 In this sentence, the speaker is describing a process where they are creating a large number of potential designs for a protein called GFP. They are using a computer program to generate these designs, and they are doing it by looking at the results of a previous stage in the process. The "iterative joint optimization stage" refers to a part of the process where they are trying to improve the designs by making small changes and testing them. The "intermediate and final points" refer to the results of these tests at different stages of the optimization process. By looking at these results, they are able to generate a large number of potential designs for GFP. The "computational pool" refers to the collection of all these designs, which they are using to find the best possible design for GFP.

 This sentence is about a process of analyzing and organizing data related to fluorescent proteins. The process involves grouping similar designs together based on their sequence similarity to known fluorescent proteins. Then, the designs are filtered and ranked using various metrics, which are explained in more detail in a section called Appendix A.5.1.5. This process helps researchers to better understand and compare the different designs of fluorescent proteins.

 This sentence is describing a scientific experiment where a protein was created and tested for its ability to fluoresce (glow) when exposed to a specific type of light. The protein was made using a process called synthesis, which involves combining different molecules to create a new substance. The protein was then introduced into a type of bacteria called E. coli, which acted as a host for the protein. Finally, the protein was tested for its fluorescence activity by shining a light with a wavelength of 485 nanometers on it and measuring how much it glowed. The results of this experiment are shown in a figure labeled "Fig. 4B left."

 In this sentence, the speaker is saying that they measured the brightness of something and compared it to a positive control. The positive control is a sample that is known to work well and is used as a reference. The speaker also mentions that they used designs that have a higher sequence identity with naturally occurring GFPs. GFP stands for green fluorescent protein, which is a protein that glows green under certain conditions. Sequence identity refers to how similar the DNA or RNA sequence of the designs is to the naturally occurring GFPs. Overall, the sentence is describing a scientific experiment where the speaker is comparing the brightness of something to a known reference and using designs that are similar to naturally occurring GFPs.

 The sentence is discussing the identification of a specific design in a well labeled B8. This design has a low level of similarity to a previously known sequence called 1QY3, with only 36% sequence identity.

 We conducted an experiment to measure the brightness of a certain type of protein called GFP (green fluorescent protein) at different stages of its development. We did this by measuring the intensity of the fluorescence emitted by the protein at three different time points: 0 days, 2 days, and 7 days. We then plotted the results of our measurements on a graph, which shows how the brightness of the protein changes over time. We compared the results of our experiment with a few other types of GFP, including avGFP, cgreGFP, and ppluGFP. The graph of our results is shown in Figure 4C.

 The sentence is saying that a type of protein called "esmGFP" takes a longer time to fully develop compared to other types of GFPs that have been studied. However, after two days, esmGFP becomes just as bright as the other GFPs.

 The sentence is saying that they wanted to make sure that the fluorescence they observed was caused by two specific amino acids, Thr65 and Tyr66. To do this, they created two different versions of a protein called B8 and a fluorescent protein called esmGFP, where Thr65 and Tyr66 were replaced with glycine. They found that these modified versions of B8 and esmGFP did not show any fluorescence, which confirms that Thr65 and Tyr66 are necessary for fluorescence to occur. The results of this experiment are shown in a figure called Fig. S21.

 This sentence is discussing the properties of two types of proteins, esmGFP and EGFP, and how they interact with light. The peak excitation of esmGFP occurs at a wavelength of 496 nanometers, which is slightly different from the peak excitation of EGFP at 489 nanometers. However, both proteins emit light at the same peak wavelength of 512 nanometers. This information is shown in a graph in Figure 4D.
User:

 This sentence is describing the results of an experiment that compared two types of fluorescent proteins, esmGFP and EGFP. The researchers measured the width of the spectra, which is a way of describing the range of colors that the proteins emit. They found that the width of the excitation spectrum (which measures the colors of light that the proteins can absorb) was narrower for esmGFP than for EGFP. However, the width of the emission spectrum (which measures the colors of light that the proteins emit) was similar for both proteins. This suggests that esmGFP may be more selective in the colors of light that it can absorb, but both proteins emit a similar range of colors.

 This sentence means that the protein called esmGFP has similar characteristics to other proteins in the same family, called GFPs. These characteristics are related to how the protein absorbs and emits light, which is important for its use in scientific research.

 The sentence means that the researchers wanted to find out how the order and shape of a protein called esmGFP compares to other proteins that are already known.

 This sentence is discussing a search for a protein sequence called B8. The search was done using two different methods: BLAST and MMseqs. Both methods found the same top result, which was a protein called tagRFP. The two proteins have 58% sequence identity, meaning they have a lot of similarities in their amino acid sequences. However, there are also 96 mutations, or differences, between the two sequences. This information is important for understanding the relationship between B8 and tagRFP, and for potentially predicting the function of B8 based on the known function of tagRFP.
User:

 This sentence is discussing a type of protein called esmGFP, which is a variant that has been designed by scientists. The closest naturally occurring protein to esmGFP is called eqFP578, which is a red fluorescent protein. However, eqFP578 is different from esmGFP in 107 places in its genetic code, which means that they are only 53% similar.

 This sentence is discussing the differences between two types of proteins, esmGFP and tagRFP. The differences are found throughout the structure of the proteins, and there are 22 mutations that occur in the interior of the protein. This is important because the interior of the protein is very sensitive to mutations due to the presence of a chromophore (a molecule that gives the protein its color) and a high density of interactions between different parts of the protein. The sentence is saying that these mutations could have a significant impact on the function of the protein.
User:

 The sentence is discussing a study that looked at a group of 648 fluorescent proteins, including a specific one called esmGFP. The researchers found that when they compared the sequence of esmGFP to the sequences of other fluorescent proteins, it had a level of similarity that is usually seen when comparing sequences from different groups of organisms (called taxonomic orders). However, this level of similarity was actually found within the same group of organisms (called a taxonomic class). This suggests that esmGFP is a unique type of fluorescent protein that is different from others in its class.

 The sentence is comparing the difference between a type of fluorescent protein called esmGFP and other fluorescent proteins to the level of difference between two types of marine invertebrates called scleractinia and actiniaria, which belong to the same larger group called anthozoa. The comparison is shown in a figure labeled 4G.
User:

 This sentence is discussing the similarity between different types of fluorescent proteins (FPs) found in different types of marine organisms. The sentence states that the closest FPs to a specific type of FP called esmGFP are found in corals and anemones, and they share an average of 51.4% of their genetic sequence. Additionally, esmGFP also shares some genetic sequence with FPs found in jellyfish, specifically the famous avGFP, with an average sequence identity of 33.4%. The sentence also includes a reference to a figure (Fig. S22) that likely provides more detailed information about the genetic sequences being discussed.

 This sentence is saying that we can use what we know about how living things change over time (evolutionary biology) to figure out how long it would take for a protein with a similar structure to develop naturally.

 In Fig. 4G, we are presenting a comparison of a protein called esmGFP with three other proteins called GFPs that come from a group of animals called Anthozoans. This comparison is being shown in a figure or diagram labeled as Fig. 4G.

 This sentence is discussing a study that used a special type of analysis to estimate how long ago different species of Anthozoans (a type of marine animal) shared a common ancestor. The analysis was done using a method called "time-calibrated phylogenetic analysis," which involves looking at the genetic differences between different species and using that information to estimate how long ago they diverged from a common ancestor. The study estimated the time of divergence in "millions of years ago" (MYA) for each pair of species.
User:

 This sentence is discussing a method for estimating the amount of time that has passed since two species of Anthozoan GFPs (green fluorescent proteins) shared a common ancestor. The researchers used a dataset of six Anthozoan GFPs and information about the species' last common ancestors and GFP sequence identities to create a simple estimator. This estimator relates the sequence identity between the GFPs to the amount of time that has passed since the species diverged from each other. The researchers used this estimator to calibrate against natural evolution, which means they compared their results to what is known about the evolutionary history of these species. The results of this study are shown in Figure 4H.

 The sentence means that the protein called esmGFP has evolved over a very long time, which is estimated to be more than 500 million years. This estimate is based on a scientific analysis.
