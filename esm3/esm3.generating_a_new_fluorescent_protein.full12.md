------------------------------
 - A simple estimator was constructed to correlate sequence identity between FPs to MY of evolutionary time between species.
- The estimator was calibrated against natural evolution using a larger dataset of six Anthozoan GFPs and species with accurate MYA and GFP sequence identities.
- The results are presented in Figure 4H.
==============================
Based on this analysis we estimate esmGFP represents an equivalent of over 500 million years of evolution from the closest protein that has been found in nature.

------------------------------
 - The esmGFP protein has undergone over 500 million years of evolution.
- The closest protein found in nature is not specified.
