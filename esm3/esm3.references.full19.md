The paper discusses the use of a designed active-site library to create thousands of functional variants of the green fluorescent protein (GFP), which is a widely used tool in biological research. The authors used a combination of computational modeling and experimental techniques to design and test the variants, and they found that many of them had improved properties compared to the original GFP.

The reason why this paper would be chosen by the authors of a paper about ESM (Evolutionary Scale Modelling) is that it demonstrates the power of combining computational modeling with experimental techniques to create new and improved biological tools. ESM is a computational method that is used to study the evolution of proteins and other biological molecules, and it relies heavily on the use of computational models to predict the properties of these molecules. By showing how computational modeling can be used to design and test new variants of GFP, the paper provides a useful example of how ESM can be applied in practice.

------------------------------
 The reference [81] is a citation to a research paper titled "Attention is not all you need: Pure attention loses rank doubly exponentially with depth" by Yihe Dong, Jean-Baptiste Cordonnier, and Andreas Loukas. The paper discusses the limitations of using pure attention mechanisms in deep neural networks, which is relevant to the field of Evolutionary Scale Modelling (ESM) because ESM often involves the use of deep neural networks to model complex biological systems.

The authors of the paper argue that pure attention mechanisms, which are commonly used in deep neural networks, suffer from a problem known as "rank collapse," where the attention weights become increasingly concentrated on a small number of input features as the depth of the network increases. This can lead to a loss of information and a decrease in performance.

The paper proposes a solution to this problem by introducing a new attention mechanism that combines pure attention with a rank-preserving operation. This new mechanism is shown to outperform pure attention in a variety of tasks, including image classification and language modeling.

Overall, the reference [81] is relevant to the field of ESM because it highlights the importance of carefully selecting the attention mechanism used in deep neural networks, which are often used to model complex biological systems. The paper provides a new approach to attention that could potentially improve the performance of ESM models.
