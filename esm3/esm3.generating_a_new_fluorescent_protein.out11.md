 - Proteins in the GFP family are responsible for the fluorescence of jellyfish and the vivid colors of coral.
- They are unique in their ability to form a fluorescent chromophore without cofactors or substrates.

 - The GFP sequence can be inserted into the genomes of other organisms.
- This allows for the visible labeling of molecules, cellular structures, or processes.
- The GFP sequence has been broadly applied across the biosciences.
- It serves as a foundational toolkit in the field.

 - The GFP family has been extensively studied through protein engineering.
- Most functional variants of GFP have been discovered in nature.

 - Rational design and machine learning-assisted high-throughput screening have been used to improve GFP sequences.
- These improvements include higher brightness, stability, and differently colored variants.
- The improved sequences typically incorporate small numbers of mutations (5 to 15) out of the total 238 amino acid coding sequence.

 - Studies have shown that only a few random mutations can reduce fluorescence to zero.
- This effect has been observed in the range of 44-46 mutations.

 - Scientists have been able to introduce up to 40-50 mutations in rare cases.
- This is equivalent to a 20% difference in total sequence identity.
- GFP fluorescence has been retained despite these mutations.
- High throughput experimentation has been used to achieve this.

 - Generating a new GFP would require materialization of the complex biochemistry and physics that underlie its fluorescence.

 - In all GFPs, an autocatalytic process forms the chromophore from three key amino acids in the core of the protein.

 - GFP has a unique structure consisting of a kinked central alpha helix surrounded by an eleven stranded beta barrel.
- This structure is responsible for GFP's fluorescence.
- GFP is commonly used as a reporter gene in biological research.
- It was first isolated from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria in the 1960s.
- GFP has since been genetically modified to produce different colors and improve its properties for various applications.
- The discovery of GFP and its use as a tool in biological research led to the Nobel Prize in Chemistry being awarded to Osamu Shimomura, Martin Chalfie, and Roger Tsien in 2008.

 - The process of generating a new fluorescent protein involves a chain of thought.
- This chain of thought includes considering the properties of the protein, such as its brightness and color, as well as the amino acid sequence that determines these properties.
- Mutations can be introduced into the amino acid sequence to alter the properties of the protein.
- The resulting protein can be tested for its fluorescence and compared to other known fluorescent proteins.
- This process can lead to the discovery of new fluorescent proteins with unique properties.

 - ESM3 is a language model that can generate design candidates for chromophore reactions and central alpha helix structures.

 - The cumulative density of sequence identity between fluorescent proteins across taxa was analyzed.
- esmGFP has a level of similarity to all other FPs that is typically found when comparing sequences across orders, but within the same class.

 - Evolutionary distance by time in millions of years (MY) and sequence identities for three example anthozoa GFPs and esmGFP.

 - The concept of using GFP sequence identity to estimate evolutionary distance by time (MY) is introduced.
- The idea of an "Estimator" is presented, which likely refers to a tool or method for making these distance estimates.
- The focus is on evolutionary relationships and how they can be understood through genetic data analysis.

 - The esmGFP protein is estimated to be over 500 million years old.
- It has inward facing coordinating residues that enable a specific reaction.
- The closest known protein to esmGFP is still quite different due to the long evolutionary gap.

 - The chromophore must absorb light to be fluorescent.
- The chromophore must also emit light to be fluorescent.

 - Light emission is highly sensitive to the local electronic environment of the chromophore.

 - Obtaining a new functional GFP requires precise configuration of both the active site and the surrounding long range tertiary interactions throughout the beta barrel.
- This is due to the fact that GFP's function is highly dependent on its unique structure and interactions.
- Any changes to the structure or interactions could potentially alter or even eliminate GFP's function.
- Therefore, careful consideration and manipulation of these factors is necessary for successful engineering of a new functional GFP.

 - A new method for generating GFP sequences involves directly prompting the base pretrained 7B parameter ESM3 to generate a 229 residue protein.
- The protein is conditioned on critical residues for forming and catalyzing the chromophore reaction, specifically Thr62, Thr65, Tyr66, Gly67, Arg96, and Glu222.
- This method is illustrated in Figure 4A.

 - The experimental structure in 1QY3 has structurally important residues for chromophore formation from residues 58 through 71.
