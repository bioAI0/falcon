 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to talk about the evolution of proteins.

Proteins are the building blocks of life, and they play a crucial role in many biological processes. But how did these proteins come to be in their current form?

Well, it all started billions of years ago, when life first emerged on Earth. Over time, these early organisms evolved and adapted to their environment, and their proteins evolved along with them.

This process of evolution is like a giant sieve, where only the most useful and effective proteins survive and pass on their genetic information to the next generation. This has been happening for billions of years, and it's still happening today.

So, the proteins that exist today are the result of billions of years of natural evolution, passing through this vast evolutionary sieve. They are the product of countless generations of organisms adapting and evolving to their environment.

We hope this explanation has helped you understand the fascinating process of protein evolution. Thanks for watching!

 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to talk about a fascinating concept in biology and evolution: the process of creating and selecting proteins.

Proteins are the building blocks of life, and they come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and functions. They're responsible for everything from transporting oxygen in our blood to breaking down food in our stomachs.

So how do these proteins come to be? Well, it all starts with mutations. Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence that can occur naturally or be caused by external factors like radiation or chemicals.

Over time, these mutations accumulate and create new variations of proteins. Nature then applies a process called selection, which filters out the proteins that don't work well and keeps the ones that do.

This process of creating random mutations and selecting the best proteins has been happening over geological time, which means it's been going on for millions of years.

So why is this important? Well, understanding how proteins are created and selected can help us develop new treatments for diseases and improve our understanding of how life evolves.

 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to be discussing a fascinating concept in biology and evolution.

Have you ever wondered why certain proteins have specific patterns? Well, it turns out that these patterns are actually a reflection of the deep hidden variables of biology that have shaped their evolution over time.

In other words, the patterns we observe in proteins are a result of the complex biological processes that have occurred throughout history. These processes have influenced the way proteins have evolved and adapted to their environment.

So, when we study these patterns, we're actually gaining insight into the underlying mechanisms of biology and evolution. It's like looking at a snapshot of the past and present, all rolled into one.

 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to talk about a fascinating topic that has been gaining attention in the scientific community: the idea that there is a fundamental language of protein biology that can be understood using large language models.

Now, you might be wondering what this means exactly. Well, let's break it down. Proteins are the building blocks of life, and they play a crucial role in many biological processes. However, understanding how proteins work and interact with each other is a complex task that has puzzled scientists for decades.

But recently, researchers have been exploring the idea that there is a fundamental language that underlies protein sequences. This language can be understood using large language models, which are computer algorithms that can analyze and interpret vast amounts of data.

So, what does this mean for non-experts like you and me? Well, it means that we may be able to gain a deeper understanding of how proteins work and how they contribute to various biological processes. This could have important implications for fields like medicine and biotechnology, where understanding protein function is crucial.

Of course, this is still a developing area of research, and there is much more work to be done before we fully understand the language of protein biology. But the fact that there is a growing consensus among scientists that such a language exists is an exciting development that could have far-reaching implications for our understanding of life itself.

So, that's it for today's video! We hope you found this explanation helpful, and we encourage you to keep following the latest developments in this exciting field. Thanks for watching!

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a topic that might seem a bit technical at first, but I promise to explain it in a way that's easy to understand.

Have you ever heard of language models? If you're not familiar with the term, don't worry, it's not as complicated as it sounds. In the context of protein sequences, a language model is simply a mathematical tool that helps us understand how proteins are made.

Now, you might be wondering why we need such a tool. Well, proteins are incredibly complex molecules that play a crucial role in our bodies. They're involved in everything from building and repairing tissues to fighting off infections.

To better understand how proteins work, scientists have developed a number of language models that can predict how different amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) interact with each other. These models have been evaluated and refined over time, and they're now widely used in the field of protein research.

So, to sum up, a language model of protein sequences is a mathematical tool that helps us understand how proteins are made. It's an important tool for scientists who are studying these complex molecules and trying to unlock their secrets.

So, in summary, language models are becoming better at understanding complex biological concepts like proteins, and this has the potential to revolutionize fields like medicine and biotechnology. Thank you for watching, and we hope you found this explanation helpful!

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about scaling laws in artificial intelligence.

Scaling laws are a set of rules that predict how the capabilities of artificial intelligence systems will grow as they become larger and more complex. These laws describe a frontier in compute, parameters, and data, which means that as we increase the amount of computing power, the number of parameters, and the amount of data used in AI systems, we can expect to see significant improvements in their performance.

This is an important concept for non-experts to understand because it helps us to better predict how AI systems will behave as they become more advanced. By understanding these scaling laws, we can make more informed decisions about how to design and implement AI systems in a way that maximizes their potential.

So, to summarize, scaling laws in artificial intelligence are a set of rules that predict how AI systems will grow in capabilities as they become larger and more complex. By understanding these laws, we can make better decisions about how to design and implement AI systems in the future.

 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to talk about a new model called ESM3, which is a frontier multimodal generative model that reasons over the sequences, structures, and functions of proteins.

Now, you might be wondering what all of that means. Let's break it down.

First, a model is a mathematical representation of a system or process. In this case, ESM3 is a model that can generate new protein sequences, structures, and functions.

Second, multimodal means that the model can work with different types of data, such as sequences and structures.

Third, generative means that the model can create new data, rather than just analyzing existing data.

Finally, proteins are the building blocks of life. They are made up of sequences of amino acids, which fold into specific structures that determine their functions.

So, ESM3 is a model that can generate new protein sequences, structures, and functions, which could have important implications for fields like medicine and biotechnology.

We hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments below. Thanks for watching!

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, I'm here to help you understand it.

The concept we're going to be discussing is ESM3, which stands for "Embodied Semantic Memory Model 3". This is a type of machine learning model that is used to help computers understand and generate natural language.

Now, let's break down what that means. ESM3 is trained as a generative masked language model over discrete tokens for each modality. This means that it is a type of model that is designed to generate text based on the input it receives.

The "masked" part of the model means that it is able to fill in missing information in a sentence or paragraph, based on the context of the surrounding words. This is important because it allows the model to generate more accurate and coherent text.

The "discrete tokens" part of the model refers to the fact that it is trained on individual words or phrases, rather than entire sentences or paragraphs. This allows the model to better understand the meaning of each word and how it relates to the overall context of the text.

Finally, the "for each modality" part of the model means that it is able to work with different types of input, such as text, images, or audio. This makes it a versatile tool for a variety of applications.

So, in summary, ESM3 is a type of machine learning model that is used to generate natural language based on the input it receives. It is trained on individual words or phrases, and is able to fill in missing information based on the context of the surrounding words. It is also able to work with different types of input, making it a versatile tool for a variety of applications.

I hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions or would like to learn more, please feel free to leave a comment below. Thanks for watching!

 Hello everyone, and welcome to this video where we'll be discussing the concept of structural reasoning.

Structural reasoning is a method used to understand the three-dimensional atomic structure of proteins. It involves encoding this structure as discrete tokens, rather than using complex architecture and diffusion in three-dimensional space.

This approach is different from recent predictive and generative models of proteins, which use more complex methods to understand the structure.

So, in summary, structural reasoning is a simpler and more straightforward way of understanding the three-dimensional atomic structure of proteins.

Thank you for watching, and we hope this explanation has been helpful!

 Hello everyone, and welcome to this video where we'll be discussing a fascinating topic in the world of science and technology. Today, we'll be talking about all-to-all modeling of discrete tokens and how it's being used to create new proteins.

Now, I know that might sound a bit complicated, but don't worry, I'm here to break it down for you in a way that's easy to understand.

First, let's start with the basics. All-to-all modeling is a technique that allows us to analyze and understand complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts. In this case, we're talking about proteins, which are made up of smaller building blocks called amino acids.

By using all-to-all modeling, scientists are able to study how these amino acids interact with each other and how they come together to form proteins. This is important because proteins play a crucial role in our bodies, from helping us digest food to fighting off infections.

Now, let's talk about the second part of this equation: discrete tokens. In this context, discrete tokens refer to the different types of amino acids that make up proteins. By modeling these tokens, scientists can better understand how they interact with each other and how they contribute to the overall structure and function of proteins.

So, what does all of this mean for the future of protein research? Well, by using all-to-all modeling of discrete tokens, scientists are able to create new proteins that are tailored to specific functions or purposes. For example, they could create a protein that's designed to target a specific type of cancer cell or one that's optimized for use in a particular type of medical treatment.

And the best part? This technique is scalable, which means that it can be used to create a virtually unlimited number of new proteins. Plus, by using ESM3 (a type of protein modeling software), scientists can prompt the system with any combination of modalities, allowing for even more precise control over the creation of new proteins.

So there you have it - all-to-all modeling of discrete tokens is a powerful tool that's helping scientists unlock the secrets of proteins and create new, customized proteins that could have a huge impact on the future of medicine and biotechnology. Thanks for watching!

 Hello everyone, and welcome to this video where we'll be discussing a recent breakthrough in the field of protein research.

Now, before we dive into the details, let's first define what we mean by "proteins." Proteins are the building blocks of life, and they play a crucial role in many biological processes. They are made up of long chains of amino acids, and their specific sequence determines their function.

So, what's all the fuss about ESM3? Well, ESM3 is a machine learning model that has been trained to predict the structure of proteins. This is a very important task, as knowing the structure of a protein can help us understand its function and potentially develop new drugs to target it.

Now, let's take a closer look at the numbers mentioned in the reference. ESM3 was trained with $1.07 \times 10^{24}$ FLOPs, which stands for "floating point operations per second." This is a measure of the computational power used during the training process. To put this number into perspective, it's equivalent to the combined computing power of all the supercomputers in the world!

Next, we have the number of proteins and tokens used in the training process. ESM3 was trained on 2.78 billion proteins and 771 billion unique tokens. A token is essentially a small piece of a protein sequence, and by training on such a large number of tokens, ESM3 is able to learn from a diverse range of protein structures.

Finally, we have the number of parameters in the model. A parameter is a value that the model can adjust during training to improve its predictions. ESM3 has 98 billion parameters, which is a staggering number and demonstrates the complexity of the model.

So, in summary, ESM3 is a powerful machine learning model that has been trained on a massive scale to predict the structure of proteins. Its development represents a significant step forward in the field of protein research and has the potential to lead to new discoveries and treatments for a wide range of diseases.

Thank you for watching, and we hope you found this explanation helpful!

 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to explain a reference that might seem a bit technical at first, but we'll break it down for you.

The reference is about a study that looked at a model called ESM3, which stands for Evolutionary Scale Modeling 3. The researchers wanted to see what would happen if they scaled up the model to a size of 98 billion parameters.

So, what does that mean? Well, a parameter is a variable that can be adjusted to improve the performance of a model. In this case, the researchers were interested in seeing how increasing the number of parameters would affect the model's ability to represent sequence, structure, and function.

Sequence refers to the order of amino acids in a protein, structure refers to the 3D shape of the protein, and function refers to what the protein does in the body. By improving the representation of these three things, the researchers hoped to create a more accurate model of how proteins work.

And it turns out that scaling up ESM3 did indeed lead to improvements in these areas! The researchers found that the model was better able to predict the sequence, structure, and function of proteins, which is really exciting.

But that's not all - the researchers also found that the scaled-up model performed better on generative evaluations. This means that the model was better able to generate new protein sequences that were similar to real proteins.

So, in summary, scaling up ESM3 to a size of 98 billion parameters led to improvements in the representation of sequence, structure, and function, as well as on generative evaluations. This is a really promising development in the field of protein modeling, and we're excited to see where it leads!

Thanks for watching, and we hope this explanation was helpful. If you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments below.

 Hello everyone, and welcome to this video where we'll be discussing a fascinating topic related to artificial intelligence.

Have you ever heard of ESM3? It's a type of AI that has been designed to be highly responsive to prompts. This means that it can quickly and efficiently generate solutions to complex problems, even when those problems involve multiple prompts.

What's even more impressive is that ESM3 is capable of finding creative solutions to these problems, even when there are no existing structures in nature that match the problem at hand. This is a truly remarkable feat, and it's one that has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach problem-solving in a wide range of fields.

So, what does all of this mean for you? Well, if you're someone who works in a field that requires a lot of problem-solving, then ESM3 could be an incredibly valuable tool for you. Whether you're a scientist, an engineer, or a business professional, ESM3 has the potential to help you find innovative solutions to even the most complex problems.

Of course, there's still a lot of work to be done before ESM3 can be fully integrated into our daily lives. But as we continue to develop this technology, we're excited to see what the future holds.

Thanks for watching, and we hope you found this video informative and helpful!

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, we'll break it down for you.

The concept we're talking about is called "aligning models to better follow prompts." Now, what does that mean exactly?

Well, let's start with the basics. A model is essentially a set of instructions that a computer program follows to complete a task. For example, a model might be used to recognize faces in a photograph or to predict the weather.

Now, when we talk about "aligning" a model, we're referring to the process of adjusting the instructions in the model so that it better matches the task we want it to complete. This is important because if the model isn't properly aligned, it might not give us the results we're looking for.

So, when we say that models at all scales can be aligned to better follow prompts, we're saying that no matter how big or small the model is, we can adjust it to better match the task we want it to complete.

This is a really important concept in the world of computer programming and artificial intelligence, and it's something that experts in the field are constantly working on.

So, there you have it! We hope this explanation has helped you better understand the concept of aligning models to better follow prompts. Thanks for watching!

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, we'll break it down for you.

The concept we're talking about is the relationship between the size of a model and its ability to respond to alignment and solve difficult prompts.

First, let's define what we mean by "alignment." In this context, alignment refers to the process of ensuring that a model is properly aligned with the task it's meant to perform. This can involve things like adjusting the model's parameters or fine-tuning its training data.

Now, let's talk about the size of a model. Generally speaking, larger models tend to be more complex and have more parameters than smaller models. This means that they can potentially be more powerful and capable of handling more complex tasks.

So, what does this have to do with alignment and solving difficult prompts? Well, it turns out that larger models are generally more responsive to alignment. This means that they are better able to adjust their parameters and training data to better fit the task at hand.

Additionally, larger models tend to show greater capability when it comes to solving the hardest prompts after alignment. This is because they have more resources at their disposal, which allows them to better handle complex and challenging tasks.

In summary, larger models are generally more responsive to alignment and better equipped to handle difficult prompts. This is because they have more parameters and resources at their disposal, which allows them to better adjust to the task at hand.

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a new green fluorescent protein (GFP) that has been generated with ESM3.

First, let's start with what GFP is. GFP is a protein that is naturally found in jellyfish and it has the ability to emit green light when it is exposed to ultraviolet or blue light. This makes it a very useful tool in scientific research because it can be used to track the movement of cells or molecules within living organisms.

Now, let's talk about ESM3. ESM3 is a type of protein that is found in a specific type of bacteria. It has been found to have a unique structure that allows it to bind to other proteins and molecules.

So, what happens when we combine GFP and ESM3? Well, researchers have found that by fusing ESM3 to GFP, they can create a new type of GFP that is even brighter and more stable than the original. This means that it can be used to track cells and molecules with even greater precision.

In summary, the generation of a new GFP with ESM3 is an exciting development in the field of scientific research. It has the potential to greatly improve our ability to study living organisms and could lead to new discoveries in medicine and biology.

Thank you for watching and we hope you found this explanation helpful!

 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to talk about fluorescent proteins and their importance in both nature and biotechnology.

Have you ever seen a jellyfish or coral glowing in the dark? Well, that's because of fluorescent proteins! These proteins are responsible for the bright and vibrant colors that we see in these marine creatures.

But why are fluorescent proteins important in biotechnology? Well, scientists have found a way to use these proteins as tools to study cells and organisms. By attaching fluorescent proteins to specific molecules or structures within a cell, researchers can track their movements and interactions under a microscope.

This has led to many breakthroughs in fields such as genetics, neuroscience, and cancer research. For example, fluorescent proteins have been used to study the development of nerve cells, track the spread of cancer cells, and even monitor the effectiveness of new drugs.

So, as you can see, fluorescent proteins are not only beautiful to look at in nature, but they also play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of the world around us.

Thank you for watching, and we hope you learned something new today!

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a fascinating topic that might seem a bit complicated at first, but don't worry, I'm here to help you understand it.

We're going to be talking about a specific type of protein structure that is found in many organisms, including humans. This structure is called an eleven stranded beta barrel with a helix that threads its center.

Now, I know that might sound like a mouthful, but let me break it down for you. Essentially, this structure is a type of protein that is made up of eleven strands of amino acids that are arranged in a specific way. These strands form a barrel-like shape, with a helix running through the center of it.

What's really interesting about this structure is that it allows for the formation of a light-emitting chromophore. A chromophore is a molecule that is responsible for giving things their color, and in this case, it's formed out of the protein's own atoms.

So, to summarize, this eleven stranded beta barrel with a helix that threads its center is a type of protein structure that allows for the formation of a light-emitting chromophore. It's a fascinating example of how the building blocks of life can come together to create something truly remarkable.

I hope this explanation has helped you understand this topic a bit better. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them in the comments section below. Thanks for watching!

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a fascinating discovery in the world of proteins.

Proteins are the building blocks of life, and they come in all shapes and sizes. They perform a wide range of functions in our bodies, from transporting oxygen to fighting off infections.

One of the most interesting things about proteins is that they can sometimes form fluorescent chromophores. A chromophore is a molecule that absorbs and emits light, and fluorescence is the property of emitting light after absorbing it.

Now, what's so special about this particular protein is that it's the only one in nature that can spontaneously form a fluorescent chromophore out of its own structure. That means that it doesn't need any external help to produce fluorescence.

This is a really unique mechanism, and it suggests that producing fluorescence is actually quite difficult, even for nature. It's a reminder that there's still so much we don't know about the natural world, and that there are always new discoveries waiting to be made.

So there you have it! A brief explanation of this fascinating protein and its unique ability to produce fluorescence. Thanks for watching, and we'll see you in the next video!

 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to talk about a new protein called esmGFP.

Now, you might be wondering what makes esmGFP so special. Well, it has 36% sequence identity to Aequorea victoria GFP, which is a protein that is commonly used in research to make cells glow in the dark. This means that esmGFP is similar to Aequorea victoria GFP, but not exactly the same.

In addition, esmGFP has 58% sequence identity to the most similar known fluorescent protein. This means that esmGFP is even more similar to this protein than it is to Aequorea victoria GFP.

So why is this important? Well, by understanding the sequence identity of esmGFP, researchers can better understand how it works and how it can be used in different applications. For example, esmGFP could be used to study the behavior of cells in the body or to develop new treatments for diseases.

Overall, esmGFP is an exciting new protein that has the potential to revolutionize the field of biotechnology. We hope this explanation has been helpful, and thank you for watching!

 Hello everyone, and welcome to this video where we'll be discussing a fascinating discovery in the world of protein engineering.

For decades, scientists have been studying a protein called GFP, or green fluorescent protein, which is found in certain species of jellyfish. GFP has become a popular tool in research because it emits a bright green glow when exposed to certain types of light, making it easy to track and study.

However, despite the intense focus on GFP as a target for protein engineering, it has been difficult to find proteins that are similar to GFP but with different properties. That is, until now.

Recently, researchers have discovered a new type of GFP that is quite different from the original. This new protein, which was found in a species of coral, is much more stable and can emit a wider range of colors than the original GFP.

What's particularly exciting about this discovery is that it was made through the discovery of new GFPs in nature, rather than through the traditional methods of protein engineering. This means that there may be many more undiscovered proteins out there that could have important applications in research and medicine.

So, to sum up, this discovery represents a major breakthrough in the field of protein engineering, and it opens up new possibilities for the study and manipulation of proteins in the future. Thanks for watching!

 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to be discussing a fascinating topic related to natural GFPs, or green fluorescent proteins.

Now, you might be wondering what GFPs are and why they're important. Well, GFPs are proteins that naturally emit a bright green light when exposed to certain types of light. They're found in a variety of organisms, including jellyfish, and have become an important tool in scientific research.

So, what does it mean when we say that similar amounts of diversification among natural GFPs have occurred over predictable timescales?

Essentially, this means that over time, different species of organisms have evolved to have slightly different versions of GFPs. These variations have occurred at a predictable rate, meaning that scientists can use this information to better understand how and why GFPs have evolved over time.

This is important because it helps us to better understand the natural world and how organisms adapt to their environments. It also has practical applications in fields like biotechnology, where GFPs are used as a tool for studying cells and other biological processes.

So, there you have it! We hope this explanation has helped you to better understand the fascinating world of natural GFPs. Thanks for watching!
