 - Language models can explore a distant design space of proteins.
- Language models can generate functional proteins that would take evolution hundreds of millions of years to discover.

 - Protein language models do not explicitly work within the physical constraints of evolution.
- Protein language models can implicitly construct a model of the multitude of potential paths evolution could have followed.

 - Proteins exist in an organized space where each protein is neighbored by every other that is one mutational event away.

 - Evolution can be represented as a network connecting all proteins.
- This network is structured within a space.
- The structure of evolution appears as a network within this space.
- Evolution can take different paths between proteins in this network.

 - Evolution follows paths where each protein transforms into the next without losing the function of the system it belongs to.
- These paths are the ones that evolution can take.
- The transformation of proteins is a crucial aspect of evolution.
- The loss of function in a system can hinder the process of evolution.

 - The text discusses the use of a language model to analyze proteins.
- The language model is able to extract unique facts and ideas from the text.
- The language model is capable of processing large amounts of data quickly.
- The language model can be used to identify patterns and relationships within the data.
- The language model is a powerful tool for scientific research and discovery.

 - The data of proteins fills a space, with dense and sparse regions.
- This space reveals the parts accessible to evolution.

 - The next token in a sequence is generated by evolution.
- Predicting the next token requires predicting how evolution moves through the space of possible proteins.
- Solving the training task of predicting the next token involves understanding the process of evolution in generating proteins.

 - The process of evolution involves the gradual change and development of species over time.
- Evolution is driven by natural selection, where organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce.
- Mutations in DNA can lead to new traits that may be beneficial or harmful to an organism's survival.
- The environment plays a crucial role in determining which traits are advantageous and therefore more likely to be passed on to future generations.
- Evolutionary history can be traced through the study of fossils and genetic analysis.
- The theory of evolution has been supported by a vast amount of evidence from various scientific disciplines, including biology, genetics, and paleontology.
- Evolutionary biology seeks to understand the mechanisms and patterns of evolution, as well as the diversity of life on Earth.
- The concept of common descent suggests that all living organisms share a common ancestor and have evolved from a single source.
- Evolutionary theory has practical applications in fields such as medicine, agriculture, and conservation biology.
- The study of evolution continues to evolve as new technologies and research methods are developed.

 - Simulations are computational representations of reality.
- Simulations can be used to study complex systems.
- Simulations can be used to predict future outcomes.
- Simulations can be used to test theories.
- Simulations can be used to train individuals in various fields.
- Simulations can be used to optimize processes and systems.
- Simulations can be used to visualize data and information.
- Simulations can be used to create virtual environments for experimentation and exploration.
- Simulations can be used to model and analyze physical phenomena.
- Simulations can be used to design and test new products and technologies.

 - A language model can predict possible outcomes of evolution.
- This ability to predict outcomes makes the language model a simulator of evolution.

 - ESM3 is an emergent simulator.
- It has been learned from solving a token prediction task on data generated by evolution.

 - Neural networks can discover the underlying structure of the data they are trained to predict.
- This ability of neural networks has been theorized.
- The theory suggests that neural networks can learn the structure of the data through the process of training.
- The idea is that as the neural network is trained to predict the data, it also learns the underlying patterns and relationships within the data.
- This discovery of the underlying structure can help improve the accuracy of the neural network's predictions.
- The theory is supported by empirical evidence from various studies and experiments.
- However, the exact mechanisms by which neural networks discover the underlying structure of the data are still not fully understood.
- Further research is needed to fully elucidate these mechanisms.

 - The task of token prediction requires the model to understand the underlying structure of evolution.
- The model must be able to identify unique facts and ideas.
- The output should be presented in an unsorted markdown list.

 - Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids.
- There are 20 different types of amino acids that can be combined to form a protein.
- The sequence of amino acids in a protein determines its three-dimensional structure and function.
- Proteins play a variety of roles in the body, including catalyzing chemical reactions, transporting molecules, providing structural support, and transmitting signals.
- Enzymes are a type of protein that catalyze chemical reactions in the body.
- Proteins can be denatured by changes in temperature, pH, or chemical environment, which can alter their structure and function.
- The genetic code in DNA determines the sequence of amino acids in a protein.
- Some proteins are involved in disease processes, such as the abnormal folding of proteins in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
- Antibodies are a type of protein that help the body fight off infections by recognizing and binding to specific foreign substances.
- Proteins can interact with other proteins or molecules to form complexes that carry out specific functions in the body.

 - ESM3 generated a new fluorescent protein
- The first chain of thought to B8 is intriguing

 - There are $\binom{229}{96}$ possible proteins at 96 mutations to B8's closest neighbor.
- The number of possible proteins is an astronomical number.
- Only a vanishingly small fraction of the possible proteins can have function.
- Fluorescence falls off sharply even after just a few random mutations.

 - The existence of C10 and other bright designs in the neighborhood of B8 confirms that ESM3 found a new part of the space of proteins that is dense with fluorescent proteins.
- This new part of the space of proteins is unexplored by nature.
- The discovery of this new part of the space of proteins was made in the first chain of thought to B8.
