While we have observed meaningful increases in performance in the base models with scale, larger models could have even greater latent capabilities that we do not observe.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but we'll do our best to explain it in a way that's easy to understand.

The concept we're talking about is the idea that as we increase the size of a model, we may be able to unlock even greater potential that we haven't yet observed.

Let's start by breaking down the sentence: "While we have observed meaningful increases in performance in the base models with scale, larger models could have even greater latent capabilities that we do not observe."

First, what do we mean by "base models"? In this context, we're talking about the starting point for a particular type of model. For example, if we're talking about a machine learning model that's designed to recognize images, the base model might be a relatively simple neural network that's been trained on a small dataset.

Next, what do we mean by "scale"? In this context, we're talking about increasing the size of the model. This might involve adding more layers to the neural network, or increasing the number of parameters that the model is using.

So, when we say that we've observed "meaningful increases in performance" with scale, we're saying that as we've made the model bigger, we've seen improvements in how well it performs its task.

But here's where things get interesting. The sentence goes on to say that "larger models could have even greater latent capabilities that we do not observe."

What does this mean? Well, "latent capabilities" refers to the idea that there might be hidden potential in the model that we haven't yet unlocked. In other words, there might be ways to improve the model's performance even further, but we haven't figured out how to do it yet.

So, the overall message here is that while we've seen some improvements in performance as we've made models bigger, there might be even more potential waiting to be unlocked if we can figure out how to tap into it.

The base ESM3 models can be prompted to perform difficult tasks such as atomic coordination and composition of prompts, despite the fact that the models have not been explicitly optimized for these objectives.
------------------------------
 Hello everyone, and welcome to this video where we'll be discussing a fascinating topic related to machine learning.

Have you ever wondered how machines can perform complex tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so? Well, that's where the concept of "prompting" comes in.

In the context of machine learning, prompting refers to the process of providing a model with a specific input or instruction that guides its behavior. This can be particularly useful when dealing with complex tasks that are difficult to program explicitly.

Now, let's take a look at the specific reference we're discussing today: "The base ESM3 models can be prompted to perform difficult tasks such as atomic coordination and composition of prompts, despite the fact that the models have not been explicitly optimized for these objectives."

What does this mean exactly? Well, ESM3 models are a type of machine learning model that have been trained on a large dataset of protein structures. These models are capable of predicting the 3D structure of proteins, which is a very complex task.

However, what's interesting about these models is that they can also be prompted to perform other tasks related to protein structures, such as predicting the atomic coordination and composition of prompts. This means that the models can be used for a variety of different applications, even if they haven't been explicitly optimized for those specific tasks.

So, in summary, prompting is a powerful tool in machine learning that allows models to perform complex tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so. And in the case of ESM3 models, this means that they can be used for a variety of different applications related to protein structures.

Likewise, the properties we evaluate generative outputs on-such as high $\mathrm{pTM}$, low cRMSD, and adherence to multimodal prompting-are only seen by the model indirectly during pre-training.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, we'll break it down for you.

The concept we're talking about is how generative outputs are evaluated. Generative outputs are essentially the results of a model's predictions, and we want to make sure that these predictions are accurate and reliable.

To do this, we evaluate the outputs on certain properties, such as high $\mathrm{pTM}$, low cRMSD, and adherence to multimodal prompting. These properties are important because they help us determine how well the model is performing.

However, it's important to note that the model only sees these properties indirectly during pre-training. This means that the model is not directly trained on these properties, but rather they are used as a way to evaluate the model's performance.

So, in summary, we evaluate generative outputs on certain properties to ensure that the model is accurate and reliable. These properties are important, but the model only sees them indirectly during pre-training.

We hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them below. Thanks for watching!

Aligning the model directly to these tasks with finetuning could elicit even greater capability differences with larger models.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, we'll break it down for you.

The concept we're talking about is called "aligning the model directly to tasks with finetuning." Now, what does that mean exactly?

Well, let's start with the basics. A model in this context refers to a machine learning model, which is essentially a computer program that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that data.

When we talk about aligning the model directly to tasks, we mean that we're training the model to perform a specific task, such as image recognition or language translation. This is different from training a model on a more general dataset, which might not be as effective for a specific task.

Now, what about finetuning? Finetuning is the process of taking a pre-trained model and further training it on a specific task. This can help improve the model's performance on that task, as it allows the model to learn from more relevant data.

So, when we combine these two concepts, we get the idea of aligning the model directly to tasks with finetuning. This means that we're training the model on a specific task, and then further refining it with finetuning to improve its performance.

Now, why is this important? Well, it turns out that using larger models can actually lead to even greater capability differences when we align the model directly to tasks with finetuning. This means that we can achieve even better performance on specific tasks by using larger models and aligning them directly to those tasks.

So, there you have it! Aligning the model directly to tasks with finetuning is a powerful technique that can help improve the performance of machine learning models on specific tasks. Thanks for watching, and we hope you found this explanation helpful!

We study how the base models can be aligned (40) to generate proteins that satisfy challenging prompts.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to be discussing a fascinating topic in the field of protein generation. Specifically, we'll be talking about how base models can be aligned to generate proteins that satisfy challenging prompts.

Now, you might be wondering what all of that means. Let's break it down.

When we talk about base models, we're referring to the underlying structure of proteins. These models are used as a starting point for generating new proteins that can perform specific functions.

Alignment, on the other hand, refers to the process of adjusting these base models to better fit the requirements of a particular prompt. For example, if we want to generate a protein that can bind to a specific molecule, we might need to adjust the base model to ensure that the protein has the right shape and chemical properties to do so.

So, when we say that we're studying how base models can be aligned to generate proteins that satisfy challenging prompts, we're essentially talking about how we can use these models to create new proteins that can perform complex tasks.

This is an exciting area of research with a lot of potential applications in fields like medicine and biotechnology. By better understanding how to align base models, we can create proteins that are more effective at treating diseases, breaking down pollutants, and more.

We hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions or would like to learn more, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks for watching!

To do this, for each model we construct a dataset of partial structure prompts, generate multiple protein sequences for each prompt, and then fold and score each of the sequences using ESM3 for consistency with the prompt (cRMSD) and foldability (pTM).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that might be a bit technical, but we'll do our best to explain it in a way that's easy to understand.

The concept we're talking about is how to construct a dataset of partial structure prompts, generate multiple protein sequences for each prompt, and then fold and score each of the sequences using ESM3 for consistency with the prompt (cRMSD) and foldability (pTM).

Let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to construct a dataset of partial structure prompts. This means we're creating a set of instructions for how we want our protein sequences to be structured. These prompts are "partial" because they don't give us the full picture of what the protein sequence should look like - they only give us a starting point.

Next, we generate multiple protein sequences for each prompt. This means we're creating different variations of the protein sequence that all follow the same partial structure prompt.

Once we have our protein sequences, we use ESM3 to fold and score each of them. ESM3 is a tool that helps us determine how well our protein sequences match the partial structure prompt we created earlier. It does this by measuring two things: consistency with the prompt (cRMSD) and foldability (pTM).

Consistency with the prompt (cRMSD) measures how closely our protein sequences match the partial structure prompt we created earlier. The lower the cRMSD score, the better the match.

Foldability (pTM) measures how likely our protein sequences are to fold into a stable structure. The higher the pTM score, the more likely our protein sequences are to fold correctly.

So, in summary, we're using ESM3 to measure how well our protein sequences match the partial structure prompt we created earlier, and how likely they are to fold into a stable structure.

High quality samples are paired with low quality samples for the same prompt to construct a preference dataset (Appendix A.4).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but I promise it's actually quite simple.

The concept we'll be discussing is how high quality samples are paired with low quality samples for the same prompt to construct a preference dataset. Now, what does that mean exactly?

Well, let's start by breaking it down. A sample is simply a piece of data that we use to make predictions or draw conclusions. In this case, we're talking about samples related to a specific prompt, which could be anything from a question to a task.

Now, when we talk about high quality samples versus low quality samples, we're referring to the accuracy and usefulness of the data. High quality samples are those that are more accurate and useful, while low quality samples are less accurate and less useful.

So, when we pair high quality samples with low quality samples for the same prompt, we're essentially creating a dataset that allows us to compare and contrast the two types of samples. This dataset is called a preference dataset, and it's used to help us understand which samples are more accurate and useful for a given prompt.

To give you a concrete example, let's say we're trying to develop a language model that can answer questions about a specific topic. We might start by collecting a bunch of samples related to that topic, some of which are high quality and some of which are low quality.

We could then pair these samples together and ask people to choose which one they think is more accurate and useful. By doing this, we can create a preference dataset that tells us which samples are more likely to be accurate and useful for answering questions about that topic.

So, that's a brief overview of how high quality samples are paired with low quality samples for the same prompt to construct a preference dataset. I hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them in the comments section below. Thanks for watching!###
==============================
ESM3 is then tuned to optimize a preference tuning loss, which incentivizes the model to put higher likelihood on the high quality samples compared to low quality samples (Appendix A.4) (41, 42).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept called ESM3, which stands for Energy-based Structured Model 3. This is a machine learning model that is used to optimize a preference tuning loss.

Now, what does that mean exactly? Well, let's break it down. The preference tuning loss is a way of incentivizing the model to put a higher likelihood on high-quality samples compared to low-quality samples. This is done by adjusting the parameters of the model to better fit the data.

So, in other words, ESM3 is a tool that helps us improve the accuracy of our machine learning models by making sure they are paying more attention to the high-quality data points.

If you're interested in learning more about ESM3 and how it works, be sure to check out the Appendix A.4 of the paper we've linked in the description below.

After aligning the ESM3 1.4B, 7B, and 98B base models, we evaluate their absolute performance, and the shift in the distribution of generations.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a reference that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, we'll break it down for you.

The reference is: "After aligning the ESM3 1.4B, 7B, and 98B base models, we evaluate their absolute performance, and the shift in the distribution of generations."

Let's start by breaking down what each of these terms means.

"ESM3" stands for Earth System Model, which is a type of computer model used to simulate the Earth's climate system.

"1.4B", "7B", and "98B" refer to the number of grid cells used in the model. A grid cell is a small area on the Earth's surface that the model uses to make calculations. The larger the number of grid cells, the more detailed the model can be.

"Aligning" means that the different models are being compared to each other to ensure that they are all using the same parameters and assumptions.

"Absolute performance" refers to how well the models are able to accurately simulate the Earth's climate system.

"Shift in the distribution of generations" means that the models are being evaluated to see if they are able to accurately predict changes in the Earth's climate over time.

So, in summary, this reference is discussing how different Earth System Models are being compared to each other to see how well they can simulate the Earth's climate system and predict changes over time.

We hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any further questions, please feel free to leave them in the comments below. Thanks for watching!
==============================
To measure consistency of a generation with a prompt, the generated sequence is folded and success is measured based on structural metrics (backbone cRMSD $<1.5 \AA$ ) and foldability (pTM $>0.8$ ).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but I promise it's not as complicated as it sounds.

When we're talking about measuring consistency of a generation with a prompt, what we're really talking about is how well a computer program can generate a sequence of data that matches a certain set of criteria.

To do this, we use a few different metrics. The first is called backbone cRMSD, which stands for "root mean square deviation of the backbone atoms." This measures how closely the generated sequence matches the structure of the original prompt.

The second metric we use is called pTM, which stands for "probability of being a transmembrane helix." This measures how likely it is that the generated sequence will be able to fold into a stable structure.

So, when we say that a generated sequence is consistent with a prompt, what we mean is that it meets these two criteria: it has a backbone cRMSD of less than 1.5 angstroms, and a pTM of greater than 0.8.

I hope that helps clarify things a bit! If you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments below. Thanks for watching!###
==============================
To ensure that the model used for evaluation is orthogonal to that used for creating the preference dataset, we conduct these evaluations using ESMFold.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to explain a technical term that might be unfamiliar to some of you: "orthogonal model evaluation."

When we're creating a preference dataset, we use a model to predict how people will rate different options. However, when we evaluate the accuracy of our model, we want to make sure that we're not just testing it on the same data we used to create it. That's where orthogonal model evaluation comes in.

To ensure that our evaluation is truly independent of our model creation process, we use a tool called ESMFold. This tool allows us to create a completely separate model for evaluation, which is "orthogonal" to the one we used for creating the preference dataset.

By using ESMFold, we can be confident that our evaluation results are unbiased and truly reflect the accuracy of our model. We hope this explanation helps! If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask in the comments below.
==============================
We examine the ability of the model to generate highquality scaffolds using challenging tertiary motif scaffolding prompts.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to be discussing a topic that may seem a bit technical, but we'll do our best to explain it in a way that's easy to understand.

The reference we'll be discussing is "We examine the ability of the model to generate high-quality scaffolds using challenging tertiary motif scaffolding prompts."

Let's break this down into simpler terms. First, let's define what a scaffold is. In the context of this reference, a scaffold is a structure that is used to support the growth of cells or tissues.

Now, let's talk about the model. In this case, the model refers to a computer program that is designed to generate scaffolds. The goal of this program is to create scaffolds that are of high quality, meaning they are strong and can support the growth of cells or tissues.

The next part of the reference talks about "tertiary motif scaffolding prompts." This may sound a bit confusing, but let's break it down. Tertiary refers to the three-dimensional structure of a protein, which is important for its function. Motif refers to a specific pattern or structure within the protein. Scaffolding prompts are essentially instructions that the computer program uses to generate the scaffold.

So, when we put it all together, the reference is saying that the computer program is being tested to see how well it can create scaffolds that are strong and can support the growth of cells or tissues, using instructions that are based on the three-dimensional structure of proteins.

We hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions or would like more information, please feel free to leave a comment below. Thank you for watching!

We prompt ESM3 with the amino acid identities and atomic coordinates of residues derived from a dataset of 46 ligand binding motifs in a set of temporally held out proteins (Appendix A.4.5).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a reference that might seem a bit complicated at first, but don't worry, we'll break it down for you.

The reference is: "We prompt ESM3 with the amino acid identities and atomic coordinates of residues derived from a dataset of 46 ligand binding motifs in a set of temporally held out proteins (Appendix A.4.5)."

Let's start by breaking down the different parts of this reference.

First, we have "ESM3." This stands for "Evolutionary Scale Modeling 3," which is a type of computational model used to predict protein structures.

Next, we have "amino acid identities and atomic coordinates of residues." These are the building blocks of proteins, and by knowing their identities and coordinates, we can better understand how they interact with other molecules.

Then we have "derived from a dataset of 46 ligand binding motifs." A ligand is a molecule that binds to a protein, and a binding motif is a specific pattern of amino acids that allows for this binding to occur. By analyzing a dataset of 46 of these motifs, we can gain insights into how proteins interact with ligands.

Finally, we have "temporally held out proteins (Appendix A.4.5)." This means that the proteins used in this analysis were not included in the original dataset used to train the ESM3 model. This helps to ensure that the model is not simply memorizing the data, but is actually making accurate predictions.

So, to summarize, this reference is describing a computational model that is being used to predict protein structures based on the identities and coordinates of amino acids, as well as a dataset of ligand binding motifs. The proteins used in this analysis were not included in the original dataset used to train the model.

We hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask in the comments below.

For each motif task, we create 1024 prompts by permuting the order of the residues, varying their position in the sequence, and varying the length of the sequence.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to explain a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but we'll do our best to make it easy to understand.

The concept we're talking about is called "motif tasks." In simple terms, a motif is a pattern or a recurring element in a sequence of data. For example, in a piece of music, a motif could be a short melody that repeats throughout the song.

In the context of our video, we're talking about motif tasks in the field of bioinformatics. Bioinformatics is the study of biological data using computational methods.

So, when we say "motif tasks," we're referring to the process of identifying patterns in biological data, such as DNA sequences.

Now, let's get into the nitty-gritty of how we actually identify these motifs. For each motif task, we create 1024 prompts by permuting the order of the residues, varying their position in the sequence, and varying the length of the sequence.

What does that mean? Well, let's break it down.

First, we take a sequence of biological data, such as a DNA sequence. We then create 1024 different variations of that sequence by changing the order of the nucleotides (the building blocks of DNA), changing their position in the sequence, and changing the length of the sequence.

By doing this, we're essentially creating a bunch of different "versions" of the original sequence, each with slight variations. We then use computational methods to analyze these variations and identify any recurring patterns or motifs.

So, in summary, motif tasks involve identifying patterns in biological data by creating variations of the original sequence and analyzing them using computational methods.

A single protein is generated per prompt.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but I promise it's actually quite simple.

The concept we're discussing is the idea that a single protein is generated per prompt. Now, what does that mean exactly?

Well, let's start with the basics. Proteins are essential molecules that perform a wide variety of functions in our bodies. They're made up of smaller building blocks called amino acids, which are linked together in a specific order to form a long chain.

Now, when a protein is generated, it's created in response to a specific signal or prompt. This prompt could be a signal from another protein, a change in the environment, or any number of other factors.

The important thing to note here is that, in general, only one protein is generated in response to each prompt. This means that the body is able to tightly regulate the production of proteins, ensuring that only the necessary proteins are created at the right time and in the right place.

So, to sum up, the concept of a single protein being generated per prompt simply means that the body is able to carefully control the production of proteins in response to specific signals or cues.

I hope that helps clarify this concept for you! If you have any questions or would like to learn more, please feel free to leave a comment below. Thanks for watching!

We evaluate success using the percentage of tasks solved (backbone cRMSD $<1.5 \AA$, pTM $>0.8$ ) after 128 generations (Appendix A.4.5).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to explain a reference that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, we'll break it down for you.

The reference we're talking about is: "We evaluate success using the percentage of tasks solved (backbone cRMSD $<1.5 \AA$, pTM $>0.8$ ) after 128 generations (Appendix A.4.5)."

Let's start by breaking down the different parts of this reference.

"We evaluate success" - This simply means that we are measuring how well something is doing.

"using the percentage of tasks solved" - This means that we are looking at how many tasks were successfully completed.

"(backbone cRMSD $<1.5 \AA$, pTM $>0.8$ )" - This is where things get a bit more technical. "Backbone cRMSD" refers to the root mean square deviation of the backbone atoms, which is a measure of how much the structure of a protein has changed. "pTM" refers to the probability of the correct topology, which is a measure of how well the protein's structure has been predicted. The numbers $<1.5 \AA$ and $>0.8$ are specific values that we are using to determine success.

"after 128 generations" - This means that we are looking at the results after a certain number of iterations or attempts.

"Appendix A.4.5" - This is simply a reference to where this information can be found in a larger document or study.

So, to summarize, this reference is saying that we are measuring success based on how many tasks were completed and how well the protein's structure was predicted, using specific values for backbone cRMSD and pTM, after 128 iterations.

We hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask in the comments below.

Preference tuned models solve double the atomic coordination tasks compared to base models (Fig.3A).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a study that looked at preference tuned models and their ability to solve atomic coordination tasks.

First, let's define what we mean by atomic coordination tasks. These are tasks that involve predicting the positions of atoms in a molecule or protein. This is an important task in many fields, including drug discovery and protein engineering.

Now, let's talk about preference tuned models. These are machine learning models that have been trained to perform a specific task, in this case, predicting atomic coordinates. The key difference between preference tuned models and base models is that preference tuned models have been trained on a larger and more diverse dataset.

So, what did the study find? Well, they found that preference tuned models were able to solve double the number of atomic coordination tasks compared to base models (Fig.3A). This is a significant improvement and shows the potential of preference tuned models in this field.

Overall, this study highlights the importance of using well-trained machine learning models in scientific research. By using preference tuned models, researchers can potentially solve more complex problems and make new discoveries.

While the base models show differences in the fraction of tasks solved $(9.5 \%$ for 1.4B, $19.0 \%$ for 7B, 26.8\% for 98B; Fig.3A), a much larger capability difference is revealed through alignment $(9.5 \%$ to $18.8 \%, 19.0 \%$ to $37.4 \%, 26.8 \%$ to $65.5 \%$ for the 1.4B, 7B and 98B models, respectively).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a reference that might seem a bit complicated at first, but don't worry, I'm here to help you understand it.

The reference we're talking about is related to the performance of different models in solving tasks. Specifically, we're looking at the fraction of tasks solved by each model.

Now, the base models show some differences in their performance. The 1.4B model solves 9.5% of tasks, the 7B model solves 19.0% of tasks, and the 98B model solves 26.8% of tasks.

However, when we look at the alignment of these models, we see a much larger capability difference. The 1.4B model's performance increases to 18.8%, the 7B model's performance increases to 37.4%, and the 98B model's performance increases to 65.5%.

So, what does this all mean? Essentially, it shows that the alignment of these models has a significant impact on their performance in solving tasks. And that's something that's important to keep in mind when working with these models.

I hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions or comments, feel free to leave them below. Thanks for watching!###
==============================
Preferencetuned models not only solve a greater proportion of tasks, but also find a greater number of solutions per task, as evaluated by the number of distinct structural clusters ( $\mathrm{TM}>0.8$ ) with backbone cRMSD $<1.5$ Åand pTM $>0.8$ (Fig.3B).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a study that looked at preferencetuned models and their ability to solve tasks.

In this study, researchers found that preferencetuned models not only solved a greater proportion of tasks, but they also found a greater number of solutions per task. This was evaluated by looking at the number of distinct structural clusters with a backbone cRMSD of less than 1.5 Å and a pTM of greater than 0.8.

So what does all of this mean? Well, let's break it down.

First, let's talk about preferencetuned models. These are models that have been trained to perform a specific task, such as image recognition or language translation. They are "preferencetuned" because they have been trained on a specific dataset that is relevant to the task at hand.

Now, let's talk about the evaluation metrics used in this study. The researchers looked at the number of distinct structural clusters with a backbone cRMSD of less than 1.5 Å and a pTM of greater than 0.8.

The backbone cRMSD is a measure of how similar two protein structures are. A value of less than 1.5 Å means that the structures are very similar.

The pTM is a measure of how well a model can predict the structure of a protein. A value of greater than 0.8 means that the model is doing a good job of predicting the structure.

So, when the researchers looked at the number of distinct structural clusters with a backbone cRMSD of less than 1.5 Å and a pTM of greater than 0.8, they were essentially looking at how many different solutions the preferencetuned models were able to find for each task.

And what they found was that preferencetuned models not only solved a greater proportion of tasks, but they also found a greater number of solutions per task.

So, in summary, this study found that preferencetuned models are not only good at solving tasks, but they are also able to find multiple solutions for each task. This is an important finding for anyone who works with machine learning models, as it suggests that preferencetuned models may be a useful tool for a variety of applications.

A shift in the distribution of ESMFold pTM and backbone cRMSD for each ligand binding motif is observed (Fig.3C; Fig.S17).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a scientific reference that might seem a bit complicated at first, but don't worry, I'm here to help you understand it.

The reference we're looking at today is "A shift in the distribution of ESMFold pTM and backbone cRMSD for each ligand binding motif is observed (Fig.3C; Fig.S17)."

Let's break this down into smaller parts. First, we have "ESMFold pTM and backbone cRMSD." These are both technical terms used in the field of structural biology. ESMFold is a software program used to predict protein structures, while pTM stands for post-translational modification, which refers to changes that happen to a protein after it has been synthesized. Backbone cRMSD, on the other hand, is a measure of how similar two protein structures are to each other.

Next, we have "Fig.3C; Fig.S17." These are references to figures in a scientific paper. Fig.3C is a figure in the main text of the paper, while Fig.S17 is a supplementary figure that can be found in the supplementary information section.

Finally, we have the phrase "a shift in the distribution." This means that there has been a change in the way that the data is distributed. In this case, the data refers to the ESMFold pTM and backbone cRMSD values for each ligand binding motif.

So, to summarize, this reference is describing a change in the way that protein structures are predicted for different ligand binding motifs, as measured by ESMFold pTM and backbone cRMSD values.

At the 98B scale, the finetuned model produces more distinct successful clusters than the base model on 37 of the 46 tested ligands, while the remaining 9 ligands were not solved by either the base or aligned model, indicating that alignment almost universally improves the faithfulness to the prompt and the foldability of the generated proteins.
------------------------------
 Hello everyone, and welcome to this video where we'll be discussing a recent study on protein folding.

In this study, researchers used a computer program to generate protein structures based on a given prompt. They compared two different models: a base model and a finetuned model.

The finetuned model was able to produce more distinct and successful clusters of protein structures for 37 out of the 46 tested ligands. This means that the finetuned model was better at generating protein structures that were faithful to the prompt and also more likely to fold correctly.

However, there were 9 ligands that neither the base nor the finetuned model were able to solve. This suggests that there are still limitations to the computer program and that more research is needed to improve its accuracy.

Overall, this study shows that using a finetuned model can lead to more accurate and successful protein structures. It's an exciting development in the field of protein folding and could have important implications for drug discovery and other areas of research.

Compared to a supervised finetuning baseline, which only maximizes the likelihood of the positive examples, preference tuning leads to larger improvements at all scales (Appendix A.4.6).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept called preference tuning.

Now, preference tuning is a technique used in machine learning to improve the accuracy of models. It's often used in situations where there are a lot of positive examples, but not many negative examples.

To understand preference tuning, let's first talk about supervised finetuning. Supervised finetuning is a technique where a model is trained on a small set of positive examples, and then fine-tuned on a larger set of positive examples. This helps the model learn to recognize the positive examples more accurately.

However, supervised finetuning has a limitation. It only maximizes the likelihood of the positive examples, which means it doesn't take into account the negative examples. This can lead to a bias in the model, where it's more likely to predict positive examples even when they're not actually present.

This is where preference tuning comes in. Preference tuning is a technique that takes into account both positive and negative examples. It works by training the model on a small set of positive examples, and then fine-tuning it on a larger set of positive and negative examples.

The result of preference tuning is a model that's more accurate and less biased than a model trained with supervised finetuning. In fact, studies have shown that preference tuning leads to larger improvements at all scales compared to supervised finetuning.

So, if you're working with machine learning models and you have a lot of positive examples but not many negative examples, preference tuning might be a technique worth exploring.

Figure 3. The ability to solve complex tasks increases with scale through alignment. ESM3 is aligned to follow atomic coordination prompts with a dataset of preference pairs constructed from prompted generations, where positive samples with good scores for desired properties (high pTM, low cRMSD) are paired with negative samples with worse scores. The preference tuning loss encourages the model to put higher likelihood on the positive samples. After training, models are evaluated by prompting with coordinates in tertiary contact.

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept called "alignment" in the context of solving complex tasks.

Let's start with Figure 3. This figure shows how the ability to solve complex tasks increases with scale through alignment. Now, what does that mean exactly?

Well, in this case, we're talking about a specific model called ESM3. This model is aligned to follow atomic coordination prompts with a dataset of preference pairs. These pairs are constructed from prompted generations, where positive samples with good scores for desired properties are paired with negative samples with worse scores.

The preference tuning loss encourages the model to put higher likelihood on the positive samples. After training, the model is evaluated by prompting with coordinates in tertiary contact.

So, in simpler terms, this means that the model is being trained to recognize and prioritize certain patterns or features in complex tasks. By aligning the model with these patterns, it becomes better at solving these tasks.

Overall, this concept of alignment is important in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, as it helps models become more efficient and effective at solving complex problems.

(A) We show the effect of finetuning on the fraction of tasks solved with 128 generations (Pass@ 128). A large gap opens between the models with scale. The response to alignment shows a latent capability to solve complex tasks in the largest model. Error bars show 2 standard deviations.
------------------------------
 Hello everyone, and welcome to this video where we'll be discussing the effect of finetuning on the fraction of tasks solved with 128 generations, also known as Pass@ 128.

In this study, we observed a significant gap between models with scale when it comes to solving complex tasks. This means that larger models tend to perform better than smaller ones.

Furthermore, we found that the largest model had a latent capability to solve complex tasks, which was revealed through alignment. This suggests that the model has the potential to perform even better with further training and optimization.

It's important to note that the error bars in our data show 2 standard deviations, which means that there is some variability in the results. However, overall, our findings suggest that larger models are better equipped to handle complex tasks.

Thank you for watching, and we hope this explanation has been helpful in understanding the impact of finetuning on Pass@ 128.

(B) Number of distinct solutions (clustered at $\mathrm{TM}>0.8$ ) generated for each tertiary motif. After finetuning we often see a number of unique structures for ligands for which we have successes.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a reference that might be a bit technical for some of you, but don't worry, we'll break it down into easy-to-understand terms.

The reference we're talking about is (B) Number of distinct solutions (clustered at $\mathrm{TM}>0.8$ ) generated for each tertiary motif. This might sound like a mouthful, but let's break it down.

First, let's define what a tertiary motif is. A tertiary motif is a specific three-dimensional structure that a protein can take on. These structures are important because they determine how the protein interacts with other molecules in the body.

Now, let's talk about the number of distinct solutions. When we're studying proteins, we often use computer simulations to predict how they will behave in different situations. These simulations can generate a number of different solutions, or possible structures, for the protein.

The (B) in the reference refers to a specific type of simulation that we use. This simulation generates a number of distinct solutions for each tertiary motif. These solutions are clustered at $\mathrm{TM}>0.8$, which means that they are grouped together based on how similar they are to each other.

Finally, let's talk about what this means for us. After we've run our simulations and generated these distinct solutions, we often see a number of unique structures for ligands (molecules that interact with proteins) for which we have successes. This means that we've been able to accurately predict how these ligands will interact with the protein, which is important for developing new drugs and treatments.

So there you have it! We hope this explanation has helped you understand this reference a bit better. If you have any questions or comments, please leave them in the comments section below. Thanks for watching!###

(C) Densities of prompted generations are shown for the base model (left) and aligned model (right) at the 98B scale for a number of randomly selected ligands. After alignment, the fidelity to the prompt (cRMSD) and quality of generations (pTM) tends to improve meaningfully.

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a reference that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, I'm here to help you understand it.

The reference we're looking at is (C) Densities of prompted generations are shown for the base model (left) and aligned model (right) at the 98B scale for a number of randomly selected ligands. After alignment, the fidelity to the prompt (cRMSD) and quality of generations (pTM) tends to improve meaningfully.

Let's break this down into simpler terms. The reference is discussing a process called "alignment" in which two models are compared and adjusted to better match each other. The "base model" is the original model, while the "aligned model" is the adjusted version.

The "densities of prompted generations" refer to the quality of the results produced by the models. The "prompt" is the input given to the model, and the "generations" are the outputs produced by the model.

The "fidelity to the prompt" is a measure of how closely the output matches the input. The "cRMSD" stands for "root mean square deviation," which is a way of measuring the difference between two sets of data.

The "quality of generations" is measured by the "pTM," which stands for "probability of target match." This measures how likely the output is to match the desired result.

So, in summary, the reference is discussing a process of aligning two models to improve the quality of the results produced by the models. The "densities of prompted generations" refer to the quality of the results, and the "fidelity to the prompt" and "quality of generations" are measures of how closely the output matches the input and how likely it is to match the desired result, respectively.

These results demonstrate that preference tuning extracts latent capability in the models.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a research paper that talks about preference tuning and its impact on model performance.

The paper's main finding is that preference tuning can extract latent capability in models. But what does that mean exactly?

Well, let's start with preference tuning. This is a technique used in machine learning where the model is trained to optimize a specific objective function. This objective function is usually defined by the user and can be anything from accuracy to speed.

Now, when we talk about latent capability, we're referring to the model's ability to perform well on tasks that it wasn't explicitly trained for. For example, if a model was trained to recognize cats and dogs, but it can also recognize other animals like birds or rabbits, then we would say that it has latent capability.

So, what the paper is saying is that by using preference tuning, we can extract this latent capability and improve the model's performance on tasks that it wasn't explicitly trained for.

In other words, preference tuning can help us get more out of our models and make them more versatile.

I hope that helps! If you have any questions or comments, please leave them below. Thanks for watching!

The capability of larger models to solve challenging tasks become far more apparent after alignment.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but it's actually quite simple once you understand it.

The concept we're discussing is the capability of larger models to solve challenging tasks. Now, what does that mean exactly? Well, let's say you have a task that you want a machine to complete, like identifying objects in an image. If you have a small model, it might struggle to accurately identify all the objects in the image, especially if they're complex or there are many of them.

However, if you have a larger model, it will have more parameters and be able to process more information. This means that it will be better equipped to handle challenging tasks like identifying objects in complex images.

But here's where it gets interesting. The capability of larger models to solve challenging tasks becomes far more apparent after alignment. Alignment refers to the process of making sure that the model is properly calibrated and optimized for the task at hand.

Once the model is aligned, it can take full advantage of its larger size and more complex architecture to solve the task more effectively. This is why alignment is so important in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

So, to sum up, larger models are better equipped to handle challenging tasks, but their full potential can only be realized after proper alignment. We hope this explanation has been helpful! Thanks for watching.

Since alignment can be performed with arbitrary objectives, this is an indication of a general ability to respond to finetuning that greatly improves with scale.

------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, we'll break it down for you.

The concept we're talking about is alignment, and specifically, how it can be performed with arbitrary objectives. Now, what does that mean exactly?

Well, let's start with alignment. In the context of machine learning, alignment refers to the process of ensuring that a model's predictions are aligned with the desired outcomes. For example, if we're building a model to predict whether a customer will buy a product, we want to make sure that the model's predictions are aligned with our goal of maximizing sales.

Now, when we say that alignment can be performed with arbitrary objectives, we mean that we can align a model with any desired outcome, not just a specific one. This is important because it allows us to use machine learning to solve a wide range of problems, not just a narrow set of predefined ones.

So, why is this an indication of a general ability to respond to finetuning that greatly improves with scale? Well, the answer lies in the fact that as we increase the scale of our machine learning models, we can fine-tune them to better align with our desired outcomes. This means that as we collect more data and train our models on larger datasets, we can improve their ability to make accurate predictions and achieve our goals.

In other words, the ability to perform alignment with arbitrary objectives is a sign that machine learning models are highly adaptable and can be fine-tuned to achieve a wide range of objectives. This is a powerful tool for businesses and organizations looking to leverage the power of machine learning to solve complex problems and drive innovation.

So, there you have it! We hope this explanation has helped you better understand the concept of alignment and its importance in the world of machine learning. Thanks for watching, and be sure to subscribe for more helpful videos like this one!
