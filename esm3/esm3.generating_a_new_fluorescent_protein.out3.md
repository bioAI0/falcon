 We sought to understand if the base pre-trained ESM3 model has sufficient biological fidelity to generate functional proteins.

ESM3 stands for Evolutionary Scale Modeling 3, which is a deep learning model used in protein structure prediction. It is a type of language model that has been trained on large amounts of protein sequence data to predict the 3D structure of proteins.

In this study, we wanted to see if the ESM3 model could accurately predict the structure of proteins that have not been previously studied. We found that the model was able to generate functional proteins with high accuracy, demonstrating its potential for use in protein engineering and drug discovery.

Overall, our findings suggest that the ESM3 model has sufficient biological fidelity to generate functional proteins, making it a valuable tool for researchers in the field of protein science.
