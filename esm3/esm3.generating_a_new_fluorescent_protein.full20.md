We sought to understand if the base pre-trained ESM3 model has sufficient biological fidelity to generate functional proteins.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a study that aimed to understand if a pre-trained model called ESM3 has enough biological accuracy to create functional proteins.

First, let's define what we mean by "pre-trained model." In the field of machine learning, a pre-trained model is a model that has been trained on a large dataset to perform a specific task. In this case, the ESM3 model has been trained on a dataset of protein sequences to predict the structure of proteins.

Now, let's talk about what it means for a model to have "biological fidelity." Essentially, this means that the model is able to accurately represent the biological processes that occur in living organisms. In the context of this study, the researchers wanted to know if the ESM3 model was able to accurately predict the structure of proteins, which are essential building blocks of life.

So, the researchers used the ESM3 model to generate a large number of protein sequences and then tested whether these sequences were able to fold into functional proteins. They found that the ESM3 model was able to generate a significant number of functional proteins, indicating that it has sufficient biological fidelity to be useful in protein engineering and drug discovery.

In summary, this study showed that the pre-trained ESM3 model has enough biological accuracy to generate functional proteins, which could have important implications for the field of biotechnology. Thanks for watching!

------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to talk about a fascinating topic - creating a functional green fluorescent protein (GFP) with low sequence similarity to existing ones.

Now, you might be wondering what a green fluorescent protein is. Well, it's a protein that emits green light when it's exposed to certain types of light. It's commonly used in scientific research as a marker to track the location of other proteins or cells.

So, why did we want to create a new GFP with low sequence similarity to existing ones? Well, the reason is that many of the current GFPs have limitations, such as being unstable or not being bright enough. By creating a new GFP with low sequence similarity, we hoped to overcome these limitations and create a more useful tool for scientific research.

To achieve this, we used a combination of computational and experimental techniques to design and test our new GFP. And the results were promising - our new GFP was found to be more stable and brighter than many of the existing ones.

So, what does this mean for scientific research? Well, it means that we now have a more powerful tool to track the location of proteins and cells, which could lead to new discoveries and breakthroughs in a variety of fields.

------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to explain why we chose the functionality of fluorescence for our project.

First, let's define what fluorescence is. Fluorescence is the emission of light by a substance that has absorbed light or other electromagnetic radiation. It's what makes certain objects glow under UV light, like some minerals or even certain types of laundry detergent.

Now, why did we choose fluorescence for our project? Well, there are a few reasons.

Firstly, fluorescence is difficult to achieve. This means that if we can successfully create a fluorescent substance, it will be a significant achievement and demonstrate our expertise in the field.

Secondly, fluorescence is easy to measure. This is important because we need to be able to accurately track and analyze the results of our experiments.

Lastly, fluorescence is one of the most beautiful mechanisms in nature. It's fascinating to see how certain substances can absorb and emit light in such a unique way.

So, in summary, we chose fluorescence because it's a challenging yet rewarding mechanism to work with, it's easy to measure, and it's simply beautiful to observe.

Studies have shown that only a few random mutations reduces fluorescence to zero (44-46).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to be discussing a study that has shown some interesting results. The study found that only a few random mutations can reduce fluorescence to zero. Now, what does that mean exactly?

Well, fluorescence is a property of certain molecules that causes them to emit light when they are exposed to a specific type of light. This property is often used in scientific research to study various biological processes.

In this study, researchers were interested in understanding how mutations in certain molecules could affect their fluorescence. They found that even just a few random mutations could completely eliminate the fluorescence of these molecules.

whereas in rare cases, leveraging high throughput experimentation, scientists have been able to introduce up to $40-50$ mutations i.e. a $20 \%$ difference in total sequence identity $(44,47,48)$ while retaining GFP fluorescence.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a scientific reference that might seem a bit complicated at first, but don't worry, we'll break it down for you.

The reference is about scientists who have been able to introduce up to 40-50 mutations in a protein called GFP, which stands for Green Fluorescent Protein. This protein is commonly used in scientific research because it glows green under certain conditions, making it easy to see and track.

Now, you might be wondering why scientists would want to introduce mutations in GFP. Well, the answer is that they're trying to study how the protein works and how it can be used in different applications. By introducing mutations, they can change the properties of the protein and see how it affects its function.

The interesting part of this reference is that the scientists were able to introduce up to 40-50 mutations while still retaining the protein's fluorescence. This is a big deal because it means that they can study the protein in more detail without losing the ability to track it.

So, how did they do it? The scientists used a technique called high throughput experimentation, which involves testing many different mutations at once. This allowed them to quickly identify which mutations were successful and which ones weren't.

Overall, this reference is important because it shows that scientists are constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible in protein engineering. By introducing mutations in GFP, they can learn more about how the protein works and how it can be used in different applications.

Generating a new GFP would require materialization of the complex biochemistry and physics that underlie its fluorescence.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to be discussing a topic that may seem a bit complex, but we'll do our best to explain it in a way that's easy to understand.

The topic we're discussing is the process of generating a new GFP, or Green Fluorescent Protein. Now, you may be wondering what exactly that means, and why it's important.

Well, GFP is a protein that is commonly used in scientific research as a marker for gene expression. It's essentially a fluorescent molecule that can be attached to other proteins, allowing scientists to track their movements and interactions within cells.

So, why is it important to generate a new GFP? Well, the current GFP that is commonly used in research has some limitations. For example, it can be difficult to use in certain types of cells, and it may not always be the best choice for certain experiments.

That's where the idea of generating a new GFP comes in. However, as the reference we mentioned earlier states, generating a new GFP would require materialization of the complex biochemistry and physics that underlie its fluorescence.

What this means is that creating a new GFP is not a simple task. It requires a deep understanding of the complex chemical and physical processes that make GFP fluorescent in the first place.

In other words, it's not something that can be done overnight. It requires a lot of research, experimentation, and collaboration between scientists from different fields.

So, while the idea of generating a new GFP is exciting, it's important to remember that it's a complex process that will take time and effort to achieve.

We hope this explanation has been helpful in understanding the concept of generating a new GFP. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them in the comments section below. Thanks for watching!

In all GFPs, an autocatalytic process forms the chromophore from three key amino acids in the core of the protein.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a topic that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, I'm here to help you understand it.

The topic we're going to be discussing is the formation of the chromophore in GFPs. Now, what exactly is a chromophore? Well, a chromophore is a group of atoms that gives a molecule its color. In the case of GFPs, the chromophore is what gives them their characteristic green glow.

So, how is the chromophore formed in GFPs? Well, it's actually formed through an autocatalytic process. This means that the process is self-catalyzing, meaning that it doesn't require any external catalysts to occur.

The autocatalytic process in GFPs involves three key amino acids in the core of the protein. These amino acids work together to form the chromophore, which then gives the GFP its green glow.

Now, why is this important? Well, understanding how the chromophore is formed in GFPs can help us better understand how these proteins work and how we can use them in various applications, such as in medical imaging or as biosensors.

So, there you have it! I hope this explanation has helped you better understand the formation of the chromophore in GFPs. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them in the comments section below. Thanks for watching!

The unique structure of GFP, a kinked central alpha helix surrounded by an eleven stranded beta barrel
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about the unique structure of GFP, or Green Fluorescent Protein.

GFP is a protein that is commonly used in scientific research as a fluorescent marker. It's found in jellyfish and is what gives them their green glow.

Now, let's break down the structure of GFP. It has a kinked central alpha helix surrounded by an eleven stranded beta barrel.

The alpha helix is a type of secondary structure in proteins, where the amino acid chain is coiled into a helical shape. The kink in the helix is caused by a specific amino acid, called proline, which disrupts the regular helical structure.

The beta barrel is another type of secondary structure, where the amino acid chain forms a barrel-like shape. In GFP, there are eleven strands of beta sheets that form the barrel.

So, to summarize, GFP has a kinked central alpha helix surrounded by an eleven stranded beta barrel. This unique structure is what gives GFP its fluorescent properties and makes it such a useful tool in scientific research.

Thank you for watching and we hope this explanation was helpful!

Figure 4. Generating a new fluorescent protein with a chain of thought.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a fascinating topic - how to generate a new fluorescent protein using a chain of thought.

Now, you might be wondering what a fluorescent protein is. Well, it's a protein that emits light when it's exposed to certain wavelengths of light. These proteins are incredibly useful in scientific research, as they allow scientists to track the movement of cells and molecules within living organisms.

So, how do we go about generating a new fluorescent protein? Well, it all starts with a chain of thought. Scientists begin by thinking about the properties they want their new protein to have. For example, they might want it to emit a specific color of light, or to be more stable than existing fluorescent proteins.

Once they have a clear idea of what they want their protein to do, they can start to design it. This involves using computer simulations to predict how different amino acid sequences will fold into a protein structure. By tweaking the sequence, scientists can create a protein that has the desired properties.

Once the protein has been designed, it's time to create it in the lab. This involves using genetic engineering techniques to insert the DNA sequence for the protein into a host cell, which will then produce the protein.

Finally, the protein can be tested to see if it meets the desired specifications. If it does, it can be used in a wide range of scientific applications, from tracking the movement of cells in living organisms to studying the structure of proteins.

So there you have it - a brief overview of how to generate a new fluorescent protein using a chain of thought. We hope you found this video informative and interesting!

------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a reference that might seem a bit complicated at first, but don't worry, we'll break it down for you.

The reference is Figure 4 (A) and it's all about a process called chromophore reaction. This is a chemical reaction that occurs in certain proteins, which causes them to emit light.

Now, in order to understand this process better, scientists have been using a tool called ESM3. This tool helps them to design new proteins that can also emit light.

So, in Figure 4 (A), the scientists are using ESM3 to prompt it with some information. Specifically, they're giving it the sequence and structure of certain residues that are required for forming and catalyzing the chromophore reaction. They're also giving it the structure of part of the central alpha helix from a natural fluorescent protein.

Once ESM3 has this information, it goes through a chain of thought to generate design candidates. These are essentially new proteins that the scientists can create in the lab, which they hope will also be able to emit light.

So, that's a brief overview of Figure 4 (A) and the process of chromophore reaction. We hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments below. Thanks for watching!

(C) esmGFP exhibits fluorescence intensity similar to common GFPs. Normalized fluorescence is shown for a subset of proteins in experiment 2.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a reference that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, I'm here to help you understand it.

The reference is "(C) esmGFP exhibits fluorescence intensity similar to common GFPs. Normalized fluorescence is shown for a subset of proteins in experiment 2."

Let's break this down step by step.

First, "esmGFP" refers to a specific type of protein that has been engineered to fluoresce, or emit light, when it is excited by a certain wavelength of light. This is useful for scientists who want to study the behavior of proteins in living cells, as they can use the fluorescence to track the protein's movement and interactions.

Next, "common GFPs" refers to other types of fluorescent proteins that are commonly used in scientific research. By comparing the fluorescence intensity of esmGFP to these other proteins, scientists can determine how bright and visible esmGFP is in comparison.

Finally, "normalized fluorescence" refers to a process where the fluorescence data is adjusted to account for differences in the amount of protein present in each sample. This allows scientists to compare the fluorescence intensity of different proteins more accurately.

In experiment 2, a subset of proteins were studied using esmGFP and their fluorescence intensity was measured and normalized. This data can be used to draw conclusions about the behavior of these proteins and how they interact with other molecules in the cell.

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a topic that may seem a bit technical, but don't worry, I'm here to help you understand it.

The reference we'll be discussing is (D) Excitation and emission spectra for esmGFP overlaid on the spectra of EGFP.

First, let's break down what this means. Excitation and emission spectra refer to the wavelengths of light that a fluorescent protein, like EGFP or esmGFP, can absorb and emit.

EGFP stands for Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein, which is a commonly used fluorescent protein in scientific research. EsmGFP, on the other hand, is a variant of EGFP that has been modified to have improved properties.

So, when we say "excitation and emission spectra for esmGFP overlaid on the spectra of EGFP," we're essentially comparing the wavelengths of light that esmGFP can absorb and emit to those of EGFP.

This information is important for scientists who use fluorescent proteins in their research, as it helps them choose the best protein for their specific experiment.

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a reference related to a predicted structure of esmGFP.

First, let's break down what esmGFP is. EsmGFP is a type of fluorescent protein that is commonly used in scientific research to visualize and track cells and molecules.

Now, let's take a look at the reference itself. The reference shows two cutout views of the central alpha helix and the inside of the beta barrel of a predicted structure of esmGFP. The 96 mutations esmGFP has relative to its nearest neighbor, tagRFP, are shown in blue.

So what does all of this mean? Essentially, the reference is showing us the predicted structure of esmGFP and highlighting the differences between it and its nearest neighbor, tagRFP. These differences are represented by the 96 mutations shown in blue.

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a reference that might seem a bit complicated at first, but don't worry, I'm here to help you understand it.

The reference is about the cumulative density of sequence identity between fluorescent proteins across taxa. Now, what does that mean?

Well, fluorescent proteins are proteins that emit light when they are exposed to certain wavelengths of light. They are commonly used in scientific research to label and track cells and molecules.

The cumulative density of sequence identity refers to how similar the sequences of these fluorescent proteins are across different taxa, or groups of organisms. In this case, the taxa being compared are orders and classes.

So, what does it mean when we say that esmGFP has the level of similarity to all other FPs that is typically found when comparing sequences across orders, but within the same class?

It means that esmGFP, which is a type of fluorescent protein, has a level of similarity to other fluorescent proteins that is similar to what we would expect to see when comparing proteins across different orders, but within the same class.

In other words, esmGFP is a unique type of fluorescent protein that is similar to other fluorescent proteins, but also has some distinct differences.

(G) Evolutionary distance by time in millions of years (MY) and sequence identities for three example anthozoa GFPs and esmGFP.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a topic that may seem a bit technical at first, but I promise to break it down in a way that's easy to understand.

We're going to be talking about evolutionary distance and sequence identities for three example anthozoa GFPs and esmGFP. Now, what does all of that mean?

Let's start with evolutionary distance. This refers to the amount of time that has passed since two species diverged from a common ancestor. In this case, we're looking at the evolutionary distance between three different types of GFPs, or green fluorescent proteins.

The evolutionary distance is measured in millions of years, or MY. So, for example, if two species diverged 10 million years ago, their evolutionary distance would be 10 MY.

Now, let's talk about sequence identities. This refers to the degree of similarity between the DNA sequences of two different genes. In this case, we're looking at the sequence identities between the three different types of GFPs.

The sequence identities are measured as a percentage. So, for example, if two genes have a sequence identity of 90%, that means that 90% of their DNA sequences are the same.

So, to summarize, we're looking at the evolutionary distance and sequence identities for three different types of GFPs. This information can help us understand how these proteins have evolved over time and how they are related to each other.

I hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments below. Thanks for watching!
==============================
(H) Estimator of evolutionary distance by time (MY) from GFP sequence identity.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept called the (H) Estimator of evolutionary distance by time (MY) from GFP sequence identity.

Now, that might sound like a mouthful, but don't worry, we'll break it down for you.

First, let's start with the basics. Evolutionary distance refers to the amount of genetic change that has occurred between two species over time. This can be measured in a variety of ways, but one common method is to compare the DNA sequences of different organisms.

The GFP sequence identity is a specific type of DNA sequence that is used as a reference point for measuring evolutionary distance. GFP stands for green fluorescent protein, which is a protein that is found in certain types of jellyfish.

The (H) Estimator is a mathematical formula that is used to calculate the evolutionary distance between two species based on their GFP sequence identity. The "H" stands for "Hamming distance," which is a measure of the number of differences between two DNA sequences.

Finally, the "MY" stands for "million years," which is the unit of time that is used to measure evolutionary distance.

So, to summarize, the (H) Estimator of evolutionary distance by time (MY) from GFP sequence identity is a mathematical formula that is used to calculate the amount of genetic change that has occurred between two species over millions of years, based on their GFP sequence identity.

We hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them in the comments section below. Thanks for watching!

We estimate esmGFP is over 500 million years of natural evolution removed from the closest known protein.
with inward facing coordinating residues, enables this reaction (49).
------------------------------
 Hello everyone, and welcome to this video where we'll be discussing a fascinating scientific discovery. Researchers have estimated that esmGFP, a protein found in certain organisms, is over 500 million years old. This means that it has evolved naturally over a very long period of time, and is quite different from the proteins we know today.

So, how did they come to this conclusion? Well, they used a technique called X-ray crystallography to study the structure of esmGFP. They found that it has a unique feature called inward facing coordinating residues, which allows it to undergo a specific chemical reaction. This reaction is important for the protein's function, and is not found in any other known proteins.

This discovery is significant because it helps us understand how proteins have evolved over time, and how they have adapted to different environments and functions. It also has potential applications in biotechnology, where scientists can use this knowledge to design new proteins with specific properties.

So, there you have it - a brief explanation of this exciting scientific discovery. We hope you found this video informative and interesting. Thanks for watching!

Once formed, the chromophore must not just absorb light but also emit it in order to be fluorescent.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept related to fluorescence.

Fluorescence is a phenomenon where certain materials absorb light at one wavelength and then emit light at a different wavelength. This is what makes things like highlighters and glow-in-the-dark toys appear to glow.

Now, in order for a material to be fluorescent, it needs to have a special type of molecule called a chromophore. A chromophore is a group of atoms that can absorb light and then emit it at a different wavelength.

However, just having a chromophore isn't enough to make a material fluorescent. The chromophore also needs to be able to emit light in order for the material to glow.

So, to summarize, in order for a material to be fluorescent, it needs to have a chromophore that can both absorb and emit light.

I hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments below. Thanks for watching!

Light emission is highly sensitive to the local electronic environment of the chromophore.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but is actually quite fascinating: light emission and its sensitivity to the local electronic environment of the chromophore.

Let's start by breaking down what these terms mean. Light emission refers to the process by which an object or substance emits light. This can happen naturally, like when a firefly glows in the dark, or artificially, like when we turn on a light bulb.

A chromophore, on the other hand, is a molecule or part of a molecule that is responsible for giving an object or substance its color. For example, the chromophore in a red apple is what makes it appear red to our eyes.

Now, when we say that light emission is highly sensitive to the local electronic environment of the chromophore, we're essentially saying that the way an object or substance emits light is closely tied to the electronic properties of the chromophore.

To put it simply, the way an object or substance appears to us - its color, brightness, and so on - is influenced by the way electrons behave within the chromophore. This means that even small changes in the electronic environment of the chromophore can have a big impact on how it emits light.

So why is this important? Well, understanding the relationship between light emission and the local electronic environment of the chromophore can help us better understand and manipulate the properties of various materials. For example, by tweaking the electronic environment of a chromophore, we might be able to create new colors or improve the efficiency of light-emitting devices like LEDs.

For these reasons, obtaining a new functional GFP would require precise configuration of both the active site and the surrounding long range tertiary interactions throughout the beta barrel.
------------------------------
 Hello everyone, and welcome to this video where we'll be discussing a complex scientific concept in a way that's easy to understand.

The concept we'll be discussing today is the process of obtaining a new functional GFP, which stands for Green Fluorescent Protein. GFP is a protein that is commonly used in scientific research as a marker to track the location of other proteins within cells.

Now, in order to obtain a new functional GFP, scientists need to make sure that both the active site and the surrounding long range tertiary interactions throughout the beta barrel are precisely configured.

The active site is the part of the protein that is responsible for its function, while the beta barrel is the structure that gives the protein its shape. The long range tertiary interactions refer to the way that different parts of the protein interact with each other, even if they are far apart.

So, in order to obtain a new functional GFP, scientists need to make sure that all of these different parts of the protein are working together in the right way. This is a complex process that requires a lot of careful experimentation and analysis.

But why is this important? Well, by obtaining new functional GFPs, scientists can better understand how proteins work and how they can be used to treat diseases and other medical conditions.

So, there you have it - a brief explanation of the process of obtaining a new functional GFP. We hope that this video has been helpful in explaining this complex scientific concept in a way that's easy to understand. Thanks for watching!

In an effort to generate new GFP sequences, we directly prompt the base pretrained 7B parameter ESM3 to generate a 229 residue protein conditioned on the positions Thr62, Thr65, Tyr66, Gly67, Arg96, Glu222, which are critical residues for forming and catalyzing the chromophore reaction (Fig. 4A).
------------------------------
 Hello everyone, and welcome to this video where we'll be discussing a recent study on generating new GFP sequences.

In this study, the researchers used a technique called direct prompting to generate a 229 residue protein. This protein was conditioned on the positions of critical residues that are involved in forming and catalyzing the chromophore reaction.

To do this, the researchers used a base pretrained 7B parameter ESM3, which is a type of artificial intelligence model that can predict protein structures.

By using this model, the researchers were able to generate a new GFP sequence that could potentially have different properties than the original GFP.

Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of using artificial intelligence to generate new proteins with specific properties.

We additionally condition on the structure of residues 58 through 71 from the experimental structure in 1QY3, which are known to be structurally important for the energetic favorability of chromophore formation (50).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to explain a reference that might be a bit technical for non-experts. The reference is: "We additionally condition on the structure of residues 58 through 71 from the experimental structure in 1QY3, which are known to be structurally important for the energetic favorability of chromophore formation (50)."

Let's break this down into simpler terms. First, "residues" refer to the building blocks of proteins, which are the molecules that make up our bodies. In this case, we're talking about specific residues, numbered 58 through 71.

Next, "experimental structure" refers to a 3D model of a protein that has been determined through scientific experiments. In this case, the experimental structure is labeled 1QY3.

The phrase "structurally important" means that these specific residues play a crucial role in the overall structure of the protein. And finally, "energetic favorability" refers to the likelihood that a certain chemical reaction will occur.

So, when we put it all together, this reference is saying that we're using a 3D model of a protein (1QY3) and focusing on specific residues (58 through 71) that are known to be important for a certain chemical reaction (chromophore formation) to occur.

Specifically, sequence tokens, structure tokens, and atomic coordinates of the backbone are provided at the input and generation begins from a nearly completely masked array of tokens corresponding to 229 residues, except for the token positions used for conditioning.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, I'm here to help you understand it.

The concept we're going to be discussing is related to a process called protein structure prediction. This is a process that scientists use to determine the three-dimensional structure of a protein, which is important for understanding how it functions in the body.

Now, let's break down the specific terms mentioned in the reference:

- Sequence tokens: These are essentially the building blocks of a protein. They represent the different amino acids that make up the protein's sequence.

- Structure tokens: These represent the three-dimensional structure of the protein. They are used to predict how the protein will fold and interact with other molecules.

- Atomic coordinates of the backbone: This refers to the specific positions of the atoms in the protein's backbone. The backbone is the main chain of the protein, and its structure is important for determining the overall shape of the protein.

Finally, the reference mentions that the input is a nearly completely masked array of tokens corresponding to 229 residues, except for the token positions used for conditioning. This means that most of the information about the protein's sequence and structure is hidden, and the prediction process must use the limited information available to make an accurate prediction.

I hope this explanation has helped you understand this concept better! If you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments below. Thanks for watching!

We generate designs using a chain-of-thought procedure as follows.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept called "chain-of-thought procedure" and how it's used to generate designs.

So, what exactly is a chain-of-thought procedure? Well, it's a method of problem-solving that involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts. Each part is then solved using a combination of intuition, creativity, and logical reasoning.

In the context of design, a chain-of-thought procedure involves generating a series of design ideas or solutions, each building upon the previous one. This process continues until a satisfactory design is reached.

For example, let's say you're tasked with designing a new logo for a company. You might start by brainstorming a list of potential design elements, such as colors, shapes, and fonts. From there, you might sketch out a few rough ideas and refine them based on feedback from others.

As you continue to iterate on your design, you might incorporate new ideas or make changes based on feedback from stakeholders. Eventually, you'll arrive at a final design that meets the needs of the company and effectively communicates its brand.

So, that's a brief overview of what a chain-of-thought procedure is and how it's used in design. We hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them in the comments section below. Thanks for watching!

The model first generates structure tokens, effectively creating a protein backbone.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept related to protein generation.

When we talk about generating proteins, we're essentially talking about creating a sequence of amino acids that will fold into a specific 3D shape. This shape is what allows the protein to perform its specific function within the body.

Now, when we generate a protein, we typically start by creating a "backbone" of amino acids. This backbone serves as the foundation upon which the rest of the protein is built.

In the context of our discussion today, we're going to be talking about a model that generates this backbone. Specifically, the model first generates structure tokens, which effectively create the protein backbone.

So, to summarize: when we generate a protein, we start by creating a backbone of amino acids. And in the model we're discussing today, this backbone is created using structure tokens.

I hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
==============================
Backbones that have sufficiently good atomic coordination of the active site but differentiated overall structure from the 1QY3 backbone pass through a filter to the next step of the chain.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept related to protein structure and function.

Proteins are essential molecules in our body that perform a wide range of functions. They are made up of long chains of amino acids that fold into specific shapes, called structures. These structures are crucial for the protein's function, as they determine how the protein interacts with other molecules in the body.

One important aspect of protein structure is the active site, which is the part of the protein that binds to other molecules and carries out the protein's function. In order for the active site to work properly, it needs to have good atomic coordination, which means that the atoms in the active site need to be arranged in a specific way.

However, even if the active site has good atomic coordination, the overall structure of the protein can still vary. This is where the concept of "backbones" comes in. A backbone is a simplified representation of a protein's structure that only shows the main chain of amino acids.

When we're studying protein structures, we often use a reference structure as a starting point. In this case, the reference structure is 1QY3. If we have a backbone that has good atomic coordination of the active site but a different overall structure from 1QY3, we can use a filter to select these backbones for further analysis.

This filter helps us identify backbones that have the potential to be useful for studying protein function, even if they don't match the reference structure exactly. By studying these backbones, we can gain a better understanding of how proteins work and how we can use this knowledge to develop new treatments for diseases.

So, in summary, the concept of backbones with good atomic coordination of the active site but differentiated overall structure from the 1QY3 backbone is an important tool for studying protein structure and function. By using this concept, we can identify new backbones that have the potential to be useful for developing new treatments for diseases.

We add the generated structure to the original prompt to generate a sequence conditioned on the new prompt.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, we'll break it down for you.

The concept we're talking about is called "generating a sequence conditioned on a new prompt." Now, what does that mean exactly?

Well, let's say you have a piece of text, like a news article or a blog post. You want to generate a new piece of text that's related to the original, but not exactly the same. That's where generating a sequence conditioned on a new prompt comes in.

Here's how it works: first, we take the original text and use it to generate a new structure. This structure is like a blueprint for the new text we want to create.

Next, we add the new prompt to the original prompt. This tells the system that we want to generate a new piece of text that's related to the original, but also includes the new information from the new prompt.

Finally, we use the new structure and the updated prompt to generate the new piece of text. This new text will be related to the original, but will also include the new information from the new prompt.

So, to summarize, generating a sequence conditioned on a new prompt is a way to create new text that's related to an original piece of text, but also includes new information.

We then perform an iterative joint optimization, alternating between optimizing the sequence and the structure.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, we'll break it down for you.

The concept we're talking about is called "iterative joint optimization." Now, what does that mean exactly? Well, let's start by breaking it down into two parts: "iterative" and "joint optimization."

"Iterative" simply means that we're going to be doing something repeatedly, over and over again. In this case, we're going to be optimizing something multiple times.

"Joint optimization" means that we're going to be optimizing two things at the same time. In this case, we're going to be optimizing both the sequence and the structure.

So, when we put those two concepts together, "iterative joint optimization" means that we're going to be repeatedly optimizing both the sequence and the structure.

But why would we want to do that? Well, the reason is that by optimizing both the sequence and the structure together, we can achieve better results than if we were to optimize them separately.

So, in summary, iterative joint optimization is a technique used to optimize both the sequence and the structure together, in order to achieve better results.

We hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them in the comments section below. Thanks for watching!

We reject chainsof-thought that lose atomic coordination of the active site (Appendix A.5.1).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, we'll break it down for you.

The phrase "We reject chainsof-thought that lose atomic coordination of the active site" might sound like a mouthful, but it's actually a pretty simple idea.

Let's start with the basics. In chemistry, an active site is a specific area on an enzyme where a chemical reaction takes place. This is important because enzymes are responsible for catalyzing chemical reactions in our bodies.

Now, when we talk about "atomic coordination," we're referring to the way that atoms are arranged in the active site. This arrangement is crucial for the enzyme to function properly.

So, when we say that we reject chains of thought that lose atomic coordination of the active site, we're essentially saying that we don't want to consider ideas that would disrupt the proper functioning of enzymes.

In other words, we want to make sure that any theories or ideas we consider don't interfere with the important work that enzymes do in our bodies.

We hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them below. Thanks for watching!

We draw a computational pool of $10 \mathrm{~s}$ of thousands of candidate GFP designs from the intermediate and final points in the iterative joint optimization stage of the generation protocol.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a reference that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, we'll break it down for you.

The reference is about a computational pool of $10 \mathrm{~s}$ of thousands of candidate GFP designs. Now, what does that mean exactly?

Well, GFP stands for Green Fluorescent Protein, which is a protein that is commonly used in biological research as a marker or a tag. It's called "green fluorescent" because it emits a green light when it's excited by certain wavelengths of light.

So, when the reference talks about a computational pool of GFP designs, it means that they're using computer simulations to generate a large number of potential GFP structures. These structures are then evaluated based on certain criteria, such as their stability, brightness, and other properties that are important for their use in research.

The $10 \mathrm{~s}$ of thousands part refers to the number of designs that are generated. This is a very large number, which means that the researchers are able to explore a wide range of possible GFP structures and find the ones that are most promising.

The reference also mentions that these designs are drawn from the intermediate and final points in the iterative joint optimization stage of the generation protocol. This means that the designs are generated through a process of iterative optimization, where the computer program tries to improve the designs based on the criteria that are important for their use in research.

Overall, this reference is about using computer simulations to generate a large number of potential GFP structures, which can then be evaluated and optimized for their use in biological research. We hope this explanation has been helpful!
==============================
We then bucket the designs by sequence similarity to known fluorescent proteins and filter and rank designs using a variety of metrics (details in Appendix A.5.1.5)
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a topic that may seem a bit technical, but don't worry, I'm here to help you understand it.

The reference we're discussing today is about bucketing designs by sequence similarity to known fluorescent proteins. Now, what does that mean exactly?

Well, let's start with the basics. Fluorescent proteins are proteins that emit light when they are exposed to certain wavelengths of light. They are commonly used in scientific research to visualize and track biological processes.

Now, when scientists want to create new fluorescent proteins, they often start by looking at the sequences of known fluorescent proteins. They do this because the sequence of a protein determines its structure and function.

So, when we say that we're bucketing designs by sequence similarity to known fluorescent proteins, we're essentially grouping together designs that have similar sequences to known fluorescent proteins. This helps us identify which designs are most likely to be successful in creating new fluorescent proteins.

But how do we filter and rank these designs? Well, that's where the metrics come in. These metrics are essentially criteria that we use to evaluate the designs. For example, we might look at things like the predicted brightness of the protein, its stability, or its folding efficiency.

By using these metrics, we can filter out designs that are unlikely to be successful and rank the remaining designs based on their predicted performance.

So, there you have it! That's a brief overview of what it means to bucket designs by sequence similarity to known fluorescent proteins and how we filter and rank these designs using various metrics.

I hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions or would like more information, please feel free to leave a comment below. Thanks for watching!

We performed a first experiment with 88 designs on a 96 well plate, with the top generations in each sequence similarity bucket.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to explain a reference that might be a bit confusing for non-experts. The reference is: "We performed a first experiment with 88 designs on a 96 well plate, with the top generations in each sequence similarity bucket."

Let's break it down:

- "We performed a first experiment" means that the researchers conducted an initial test or trial.
- "with 88 designs on a 96 well plate" refers to the number of designs being tested and the type of plate they were tested on. A 96 well plate is a common tool used in scientific experiments, and it has 96 small wells where samples can be placed.
- "with the top generations in each sequence similarity bucket" means that the researchers selected the best designs from each group of similar designs.

So, in summary, the researchers conducted an initial experiment with 88 designs on a 96 well plate, and they selected the best designs from each group of similar designs.

We hope this explanation helps! If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask in the comments below. Thank you for watching!

Each generated protein was synthesized, expressed in E. coli, and measured for fluorescence activity at an excitation wavelength of $485 \mathrm{~nm}$ Fig. 4B left.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a scientific reference that might seem a bit complicated at first, but don't worry, I'm here to help you understand it.

The reference we're looking at today is about generating proteins and measuring their fluorescence activity. Specifically, the researchers synthesized each protein, expressed it in E. coli, and then measured its fluorescence activity at an excitation wavelength of $485 \mathrm{~nm}$.

Now, let's break down what all of that means. First, synthesizing a protein means creating it in a lab setting. This is often done using genetic engineering techniques to create a specific sequence of amino acids that will fold into the desired protein structure.

Next, expressing the protein in E. coli means inserting the gene for the protein into the DNA of E. coli bacteria. This allows the bacteria to produce the protein, which can then be harvested and studied.

Finally, measuring fluorescence activity at an excitation wavelength of $485 \mathrm{~nm}$ means shining a light with a wavelength of $485 \mathrm{~nm}$ onto the protein and measuring how much light it emits in response. This can give researchers information about the structure and function of the protein.

So, to summarize, this reference is about creating proteins in a lab, expressing them in bacteria, and measuring their fluorescence activity to learn more about them. I hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments below.

We measured brightness similar to positive controls from a number of designs that have higher sequence identity with naturally occurring GFPs.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to explain a scientific reference that might seem a bit complicated at first. The reference is: "We measured brightness similar to positive controls from a number of designs that have higher sequence identity with naturally occurring GFPs."

Let's break it down:

- "We measured brightness" means that the researchers were looking at how bright something was.
- "Similar to positive controls" means that they compared their results to a known standard.
- "From a number of designs" means that they tested different versions of something.
- "That have higher sequence identity with naturally occurring GFPs" means that they were testing variations of a protein called GFP, which is found in nature.

So, in simpler terms, the researchers were testing different versions of a protein called GFP to see how bright they were compared to a known standard. They found that the versions that were more similar to the natural GFP were also the brightest.

We hope this explanation helps! If you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments below. Thanks for watching!

We also identify a design in well B8 (highlighted in a black circle) with only $36 \%$ sequence identity to the 1QY3 sequence and $57 \%$ sequence identity to the nearest existing fluorescent protein, tagRFP.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to explain a reference that might be a bit confusing for non-experts.

The reference we're talking about is "We also identify a design in well B8 (highlighted in a black circle) with only $36 \%$ sequence identity to the 1QY3 sequence and $57 \%$ sequence identity to the nearest existing fluorescent protein, tagRFP."

Let's break this down. First, "sequence identity" refers to how similar two DNA or protein sequences are to each other. In this case, the researchers found a design in well B8 that has only $36 \%$ sequence identity to the 1QY3 sequence. This means that the design in well B8 is quite different from the 1QY3 sequence.

Next, the researchers found that the design in well B8 has $57 \%$ sequence identity to the nearest existing fluorescent protein, tagRFP. This means that the design in well B8 is more similar to tagRFP than it is to the 1QY3 sequence.

So, what does all of this mean? Essentially, the researchers found a new design in well B8 that is quite different from the 1QY3 sequence, but is more similar to tagRFP. This could be useful for creating new fluorescent proteins with different properties.

We hope this explanation helps! If you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments below. Thanks for watching!###

This design was 50x less bright than natural GFPs and its chromophore matured over the course of a week, instead of in under a day, but it presents a signal of function in a new portion of sequence space that to our knowledge has not been found in nature or through protein engineering.
------------------------------
 Hello everyone, and welcome to this video where we'll be discussing a recent breakthrough in the field of protein engineering.

In this study, researchers were able to create a new type of protein that is 50 times less bright than natural GFPs, which are commonly used as fluorescent markers in biological research. This may seem like a negative result, but it actually presents a unique opportunity for scientists to study proteins in a new way.

Additionally, the chromophore in this new protein takes a week to mature, which is much longer than the typical maturation time of under a day for natural GFPs. This slower maturation process allows for more precise control over the protein's function, which is important for many applications in biotechnology.

But perhaps the most exciting aspect of this discovery is that it represents a signal of function in a new portion of sequence space that has not been found in nature or through protein engineering before. This means that there is a whole new area of protein design that can be explored, which could lead to new and innovative applications in medicine, biotechnology, and beyond.

So while this new protein may not be as bright as natural GFPs, it represents a major step forward in the field of protein engineering and opens up exciting new possibilities for scientific research. Thank you for watching!
==============================
We continue the chain of thought starting from the sequence of the design in well B8 to generate a protein with improved brightness, using the same iterative joint optimization and ranking procedure as above.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a scientific concept that may seem a bit complex at first, but I promise to break it down for you in a way that's easy to understand.

The concept we'll be discussing is the process of using a sequence of design to generate a protein with improved brightness. Now, I know that sounds like a mouthful, but let me explain.

In the world of science, proteins are incredibly important. They're the building blocks of life, and they play a crucial role in many biological processes. However, sometimes scientists need to modify these proteins in order to make them more effective.

One way to do this is by using a process called iterative joint optimization and ranking. This process involves taking a sequence of design, like the one found in well B8, and using it to generate a protein with improved brightness.

So, how does this process work? Well, it involves a lot of trial and error. Scientists will take the sequence of design and make small changes to it, testing each new version to see if it's more effective than the last.

Over time, this iterative process allows scientists to create a protein that's much brighter than the original. And that's a big deal, because brighter proteins can be used in a variety of applications, from medical imaging to drug discovery.

So, there you have it! That's the process of using a sequence of design to generate a protein with improved brightness. I hope this explanation has been helpful, and if you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments below. Thanks for watching!

We create a second 96 well plate of designs, and using the same plate reader assay we find that several designs in this cohort have a brightness in the range of GFPs found in nature.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to explain a reference that might be a bit technical for non-experts.

In this reference, the researchers created a second 96 well plate of designs. This means they made a plate with 96 small wells, each containing a different design. They then used a plate reader assay to measure the brightness of each design.

The plate reader assay is a common technique used in biology to measure the amount of a specific molecule in a sample. In this case, the researchers were measuring the brightness of the designs.

What they found was that several designs in this cohort had a brightness in the range of GFPs found in nature. GFP stands for green fluorescent protein, which is a protein that naturally occurs in some organisms and is used as a marker in biological research.

So, what this means is that the designs the researchers created were as bright as some of the brightest naturally occurring proteins. This is a significant finding because it shows that the researchers were able to create designs that are just as bright as those found in nature.

We hope this explanation helps! If you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments below. Thanks for watching!

The best design, located in well C10 of the second plate (Fig. 4B right), we designate esmGFP.

 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to explain a reference that might be a bit confusing for non-experts. The reference is "The best design, located in well C10 of the second plate (Fig. 4B right), we designate esmGFP."

Let's break it down. First, "The best design" refers to the most effective or efficient design that was created. This could be a design for a product, a process, or anything else that requires planning and execution.

Next, "located in well C10 of the second plate" means that the design is physically located in a specific spot on a plate. This plate could be a lab plate used for experiments or a plate used for manufacturing.

Finally, "we designate esmGFP" means that the design has been given a specific name or label. In this case, the label is "esmGFP." This label could be used to identify the design in future experiments or manufacturing processes.

So, to summarize, "The best design, located in well C10 of the second plate (Fig. 4B right), we designate esmGFP" means that a specific design has been created, located, and labeled for future use.

We hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions or comments, please leave them below. Thanks for watching!

We find esmGFP exhibits brightness in the distribution of natural GFPs.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to be discussing a scientific reference that talks about the brightness of esmGFP, a type of fluorescent protein.

First, let's define what esmGFP is. It's a type of protein that can emit light when it's exposed to certain wavelengths of light. This makes it useful for scientists who want to study cells or other biological materials, as they can use esmGFP to "tag" specific parts of the cell and track their movements or interactions.

Now, let's talk about the reference itself. The authors of the study found that esmGFP exhibits brightness in the distribution of natural GFPs. What does this mean? Well, GFP stands for green fluorescent protein, which is another type of fluorescent protein that's commonly used in scientific research. The authors are saying that esmGFP is similar in brightness to natural GFPs, which means it's a good candidate for use in experiments where scientists need a bright, easily detectable signal.

So, in summary, the reference is saying that esmGFP is a useful tool for scientists because it's bright and similar in brightness to other fluorescent proteins commonly used in research. We hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments below.

We evaluated the fluorescence intensity at 0 , 2 , and 7 days of chromophore maturation, and plot these measurements for esmGFP, a replicate of B8, a chromophore knockout of B8, along with three natural GFPs avGFP, cgreGFP, ppluGFP (Fig. 4C).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a scientific study that evaluated the fluorescence intensity of a protein called esmGFP, as well as a few other proteins, at different stages of chromophore maturation.

Now, let's break down what that means. Chromophore maturation is the process by which a protein, in this case esmGFP, becomes fluorescent. This happens when a small molecule called a chromophore binds to the protein, causing it to emit light.

In this study, the researchers measured the fluorescence intensity of esmGFP, as well as a few other proteins, at three different time points: 0 days, 2 days, and 7 days. They then plotted these measurements on a graph, which you can see in Figure 4C.

The graph shows that esmGFP has a higher fluorescence intensity than the other proteins at all three time points. This suggests that esmGFP is a more efficient fluorescent protein than the others.

Additionally, the researchers also created a chromophore knockout of esmGFP, which means they removed the chromophore from the protein. As you can see on the graph, this resulted in a much lower fluorescence intensity, confirming that the chromophore is necessary for esmGFP to fluoresce.

Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the fluorescence properties of esmGFP and other fluorescent proteins, which could have important implications for various scientific fields.

Thank you for watching, and we hope you found this explanation helpful!
==============================
esmGFP takes longer to mature than the known GFPs that we measured, but achieves a comparable brightness after two days.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to explain a scientific reference that might seem a bit complicated at first, but we'll break it down for you.

The reference is about a protein called esmGFP, which is a type of fluorescent protein that scientists use to study cells and other biological structures. The reference says that esmGFP takes longer to mature than other fluorescent proteins that have been studied, but it eventually becomes just as bright after two days.

So what does that mean? Well, when scientists use fluorescent proteins like esmGFP, they need to wait for the protein to "mature" or become fully functional before they can use it to study cells. This process can take some time, and the reference is saying that esmGFP takes a bit longer to mature than other fluorescent proteins that have been studied.

However, the good news is that once esmGFP does mature, it becomes just as bright as the other fluorescent proteins. This means that scientists can still use esmGFP to study cells and other structures, even though it takes a bit longer to get started.

So there you have it! We hope this explanation helps you understand the reference a bit better. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them below. Thanks for watching!

To validate that fluorescence was mediated by the intended Thr65 and Tyr66, we show that B8 and esmGFP variants where these residues were mutated to glycine lost fluorescence activity (Fig. S21).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a scientific study that used a technique called fluorescence to study a protein called B8 and a variant of it called esmGFP.

In this study, the researchers wanted to make sure that the fluorescence they observed was actually coming from the intended amino acids in the protein, which are called Thr65 and Tyr66. To do this, they created two new versions of the protein where these amino acids were replaced with glycine.

When they tested these new versions, they found that they no longer fluoresced, which means that the fluorescence they observed in the original protein was indeed coming from Thr65 and Tyr66.

So, in summary, the researchers used a technique called fluorescence to study a protein, and they validated their results by creating new versions of the protein where the amino acids they were interested in were replaced with glycine.

Analysis of the excitation and emission spectra of esmGFP reveals that its peak excitation occurs at $496 \mathrm{~nm}$, which is shifted $7 \mathrm{~nm}$ relative to the $489 \mathrm{~nm}$ peak for EGFP, while both proteins emit at a peak of $512 \mathrm{~nm}$ (Fig. 4D).
------------------------------
 Hello everyone, and welcome to this video where we'll be discussing the analysis of the excitation and emission spectra of esmGFP.

First, let's define what we mean by excitation and emission spectra. Excitation spectra refer to the wavelengths of light that are absorbed by a fluorescent protein, while emission spectra refer to the wavelengths of light that are emitted by the protein.

In this study, the researchers found that the peak excitation of esmGFP occurs at 496 nanometers, which is shifted by 7 nanometers relative to the peak excitation of EGFP at 489 nanometers. This means that esmGFP absorbs light at a slightly different wavelength than EGFP.

However, both proteins emit light at a peak of 512 nanometers, which is the same for both proteins. This means that the color of light emitted by esmGFP and EGFP is the same.

Overall, this study provides valuable information about the excitation and emission spectra of esmGFP, which can be useful for researchers who want to use this protein for imaging or other applications.

Thank you for watching, and we hope you found this explanation helpful!
==============================
The shapes of the spectra indicated a narrower full-widthhalf-maximum (FWHM) for the excitation spectrum of esmGFP (39mm for esmGFP vs $56 \mathrm{~nm}$ for EGFP), whereas the FWHM of their emission spectra were highly comparable ( $35 \mathrm{~nm}$ and $39 \mathrm{~nm}$, respectively).
------------------------------
 Hello everyone, and welcome to this video where we'll be discussing the shapes of spectra and what they mean.

In this particular reference, the authors are comparing the shapes of the spectra of two different types of fluorescent proteins: esmGFP and EGFP. They found that the excitation spectrum of esmGFP had a narrower full-width half-maximum (FWHM) than EGFP, which means that esmGFP is more selective in the wavelengths of light it can absorb.

On the other hand, the FWHM of their emission spectra were highly comparable, which means that both proteins emit light at similar wavelengths.

So, in summary, the shapes of the spectra can tell us a lot about the properties of fluorescent proteins and how they interact with light.

Thanks for watching, and we hope this explanation was helpful!

Overall esmGFP exhibits spectral properties consistent with known GFPs.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a reference that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, I'm here to explain it to you in a way that's easy to understand.

The reference we're talking about is "Overall esmGFP exhibits spectral properties consistent with known GFPs." Now, what does that mean?

Well, let's start by breaking it down. "Overall" means that the statement is a general observation about something. In this case, it's about a protein called esmGFP.

"esmGFP" is a type of green fluorescent protein, which is a protein that glows green under certain conditions. It's often used in scientific research as a marker to track the location of other proteins or cells.

"Spectral properties" refer to the way that esmGFP interacts with light. Specifically, it means that esmGFP absorbs and emits light in a way that is similar to other known GFPs.

"Consistent with known GFPs" means that the way esmGFP interacts with light is similar to other GFPs that have been studied before. This is important because it helps scientists understand how esmGFP works and how it can be used in research.

So, to sum it up, the reference "Overall esmGFP exhibits spectral properties consistent with known GFPs" means that esmGFP, a type of green fluorescent protein, interacts with light in a way that is similar to other GFPs that have been studied before.

We next sought to understand how the sequence and structure of esmGFP compares to known proteins.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a topic that may seem a bit technical, but I promise to break it down in a way that's easy to understand.

So, let's start with the basics. EsmGFP is a type of protein that's commonly used in scientific research. It's known for its ability to glow under certain conditions, which makes it a useful tool for studying cells and other biological materials.

Now, when scientists study proteins like EsmGFP, they often compare them to other known proteins to better understand their structure and function. This is where the phrase "sequence and structure" comes in.

The "sequence" refers to the order of amino acids that make up the protein. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and the specific order in which they're arranged can have a big impact on how the protein behaves.

The "structure" refers to the three-dimensional shape that the protein takes on. This shape is determined by the interactions between the different amino acids in the sequence, and it can also have a big impact on how the protein functions.

So, when scientists say they're trying to understand how the sequence and structure of EsmGFP compares to known proteins, they're essentially trying to figure out how it's similar to or different from other proteins that have already been studied.

This information can be really valuable for a number of reasons. For example, it can help scientists identify new uses for EsmGFP, or it can help them design new proteins that have similar properties.

I hope that helps! If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them in the comments section below. Thanks for watching!

A BLAST (51) search against the non-redundant protein sequences database and an MMseqs (52) search of ESM3's training set report the same top hit-tagRFP, which was also the nearest neighbor to B8-with $58 \%$ sequence identity, representing 96 mutations throughout the sequence.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a reference that might seem a bit complicated at first, but don't worry, I'm here to help you understand it.

The reference we're talking about is a BLAST search against the non-redundant protein sequences database and an MMseqs search of ESM3's training set. These searches were conducted to find the top hit for a protein called B8.

The top hit that was found was a protein called tagRFP, which had 58% sequence identity with B8. This means that there were 96 mutations throughout the sequence of tagRFP compared to B8.

So, what does all of this mean? Well, essentially, it means that tagRFP is the closest protein to B8 that has been identified so far. This is important because it can help researchers better understand the structure and function of B8, which could lead to new discoveries and advancements in the field.

I hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions or would like more information, please feel free to leave a comment below. Thanks for watching!###

tagRFP is a designed variant, and the closest wildtype sequence to esmGFP from the natural world is eqFP578, a red fluorescent protein, which differs from esmGFP by 107 sequence positions ( $53 \%$ identity).
------------------------------
 Hello everyone, and welcome to this video where we'll be discussing a reference related to fluorescent proteins.

Fluorescent proteins are proteins that emit light when they are exposed to certain wavelengths of light. They are commonly used in scientific research to label and track cells and other biological structures.

In this reference, we are discussing two specific fluorescent proteins: tagRFP and esmGFP. tagRFP is a designed variant, meaning that it was created in a lab by modifying an existing fluorescent protein. esmGFP, on the other hand, is a naturally occurring fluorescent protein.

The closest wildtype sequence to esmGFP is eqFP578, which is a red fluorescent protein. eqFP578 differs from esmGFP by 107 sequence positions, which means that they are only about 53% identical.

So, in summary, this reference is discussing the differences between two fluorescent proteins, one of which is a designed variant and the other is a naturally occurring protein. The closest wildtype sequence to esmGFP is eqFP578, which is a red fluorescent protein that differs from esmGFP by 107 sequence positions.

I hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments below. Thanks for watching!
==============================
Sequence differences between esmGFP and tagRFP occur throughout the structure (Fig. 4E) with 22 mutations occurring in the protein's interior, which is known to be intensely sensitive to mutations due to chromophore proximity and a high density of interactions (46).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a reference that talks about the differences between two types of proteins called esmGFP and tagRFP.

Now, you might be wondering what these proteins are and why they're important. Well, esmGFP and tagRFP are both fluorescent proteins that are commonly used in scientific research to help visualize and study different biological processes.

The reference we're discussing today specifically looks at the differences between these two proteins at the molecular level. It found that there are 22 mutations that occur in the interior of the protein, which is a really important area because it's where the chromophore (the part of the protein that gives it its fluorescent properties) is located.

This is significant because the interior of the protein is known to be very sensitive to mutations due to the high density of interactions that occur there. In fact, even small changes in this area can have a big impact on the protein's function.

So, what does all of this mean for non-experts? Well, it's important to understand that even small differences between proteins can have a big impact on their function. This is why scientists spend a lot of time studying these differences and trying to understand how they affect the proteins' behavior.

Overall, this reference helps us better understand the intricacies of protein structure and function, which is important for advancing our knowledge of biology and developing new treatments for diseases.

Examination of a sequence alignment of 648 natural and designed GFP-like fluorescent proteins revealed that esmGFP
has the level of similarity to all other FPs that is typically found when comparing sequences across taxonomic orders, but within the same taxonomic class (Fig. 4F).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a study that examined a sequence alignment of 648 natural and designed GFP-like fluorescent proteins. The study found that esmGFP has a level of similarity to all other FPs that is typically found when comparing sequences across taxonomic orders, but within the same taxonomic class.

Now, let's break that down a bit. Taxonomic orders are a way of grouping organisms based on their characteristics and evolutionary history. For example, humans belong to the order Primates, which also includes monkeys and apes. Taxonomic classes are a higher level of grouping, and humans belong to the class Mammalia, which includes all mammals.

So, what the study found is that esmGFP has a level of similarity to other fluorescent proteins that is similar to what you would expect to see when comparing sequences across different taxonomic orders, but within the same taxonomic class. This means that esmGFP is quite different from other fluorescent proteins, even though they all belong to the same class.

This is an important finding because it helps us understand the diversity of fluorescent proteins and how they have evolved over time. It also has implications for the design of new fluorescent proteins for use in research and biotechnology.

So, that's a brief overview of the study and its findings. I hope this has been helpful! If you have any questions or comments, please leave them in the comments section below. Thanks for watching!
==============================
For example, the difference of esmGFP to other FPs is similar to level of difference between FPs belonging to the orders of scleractinia (stony corals) and actiniaria (sea anemones) both of which belong to the larger class anthozoa of marine invertebrates (Fig. 4G).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a reference that compares the difference between esmGFP and other fluorescent proteins to the difference between two types of marine invertebrates.

First, let's define some terms. EsmGFP is a type of fluorescent protein, which is a protein that emits light when it's exposed to certain wavelengths of light. Other fluorescent proteins include GFP, YFP, and CFP.

Now, let's talk about the comparison. The reference says that the difference between esmGFP and other fluorescent proteins is similar to the level of difference between two types of marine invertebrates: scleractinia and actiniaria. Both of these types of marine invertebrates belong to the larger class anthozoa.

So, what does this mean? Essentially, the reference is saying that the difference between esmGFP and other fluorescent proteins is not very big, just like the difference between scleractinia and actiniaria. This is important because it means that esmGFP can be used in place of other fluorescent proteins in certain experiments without significantly changing the results.

I hope this explanation helps! If you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments below. Thanks for watching!
==============================
The closest FPs to esmGFP come from the anthozoa class (corals and anemones), average sequence identity $51.4 \%$, but esmGFP also shares some sequence identity with FPs from the hydrozoa (jellyfish) where the famous avGFP was discovered, average sequence identity $33.4 \%$ (Fig. S22).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a reference related to fluorescent proteins, or FPs for short.

FPs are proteins that emit light when they are exposed to certain wavelengths of light. They are commonly used in scientific research to label and track cells and other biological structures.

The reference we'll be discussing today is about a specific type of FP called esmGFP. This FP is particularly interesting because it shares some sequence identity with FPs from both corals and anemones, as well as jellyfish.

To break this down a bit further, the reference states that the closest FPs to esmGFP come from the anthozoa class, which includes corals and anemones. On average, these FPs share about 51.4% sequence identity with esmGFP.

Additionally, esmGFP also shares some sequence identity with FPs from the hydrozoa class, which includes jellyfish. Specifically, the famous avGFP, which was discovered in jellyfish, shares about 33.4% sequence identity with esmGFP.

So, what does all of this mean? Essentially, it suggests that esmGFP may have evolved from a common ancestor with FPs from both corals and anemones, as well as jellyfish. This is an important finding because it helps us better understand the evolutionary history of FPs and how they have diversified over time.

I hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions or would like to learn more, please feel free to leave a comment below. Thanks for watching!

We can draw insight from evolutionary biology on the amount of time it would take for a protein with similar sequence identity to arise through natural evolution.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to talk about how we can use evolutionary biology to understand the amount of time it would take for a protein with similar sequence identity to arise through natural evolution.

First, let's define what we mean by "sequence identity." This refers to the degree of similarity between two protein sequences. The higher the sequence identity, the more similar the two proteins are.

Now, let's talk about evolution. Evolution is the process by which species change over time. This happens through a combination of genetic mutations, natural selection, and other factors.

When it comes to proteins, evolution can lead to changes in the amino acid sequence of the protein. These changes can be beneficial, harmful, or neutral. Over time, beneficial changes are more likely to be passed on to future generations, while harmful changes are less likely to be passed on.

So, how does this relate to the amount of time it would take for a protein with similar sequence identity to arise through natural evolution? Well, we can use the rate of evolution to estimate how long it would take for a protein to evolve to a certain level of sequence identity.

For example, if we know the rate of evolution for a particular protein, we can calculate how long it would take for that protein to evolve to a certain level of sequence identity. This can be useful for understanding the evolutionary history of different species, as well as for predicting how proteins might evolve in the future.

In summary, by using evolutionary biology, we can gain insight into the amount of time it would take for a protein with similar sequence identity to arise through natural evolution. This can help us better understand the evolutionary history of different species and predict how proteins might evolve in the future.

In Fig. 4G we show esmGFP alongside three Anthozoan GFPs.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a scientific reference that may seem a bit complicated at first, but don't worry, we'll break it down for you.

The reference we're talking about is "In Fig. 4G we show esmGFP alongside three Anthozoan GFPs." Now, let's start by breaking down what each of these terms means.

"Fig. 4G" refers to a specific figure in a scientific paper. This figure is likely a graph or image that shows some kind of data or results.

"esmGFP" is a type of protein that is commonly used in scientific research. It stands for "enhanced supermonomer green fluorescent protein."

"Anthozoan GFPs" are also types of proteins that are commonly used in scientific research. They are found in a group of animals called Anthozoans, which includes corals and sea anemones.

So, when the reference says "In Fig. 4G we show esmGFP alongside three Anthozoan GFPs," it means that the researchers are showing a comparison between the esmGFP protein and three different types of GFPs found in Anthozoans.

This comparison is likely important for understanding the properties and functions of these proteins, and could have implications for a variety of scientific fields, such as biotechnology and medicine.

We hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any further questions or would like to learn more about this topic, please feel free to leave a comment below. Thanks for watching!

We use a recent time-calibrated phylogenetic analysis of the Anthozoans (53) that estimated the millions of years ago (MYA) to last common ancestors to estimate evolutionary time between each pair of these species.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to explain a reference that might be a bit tricky for non-experts to understand. The reference is: "We use a recent time-calibrated phylogenetic analysis of the Anthozoans (53) that estimated the millions of years ago (MYA) to last common ancestors to estimate evolutionary time between each pair of these species."

Let's break it down. First, "Anthozoans" refers to a group of animals that includes corals, sea anemones, and jellyfish. "Phylogenetic analysis" is a method used to study the evolutionary relationships between different species. "Time-calibrated" means that the analysis includes information about when different species evolved.

The "(53)" refers to a specific study that was used as a reference for this analysis. This study estimated the "millions of years ago (MYA)" to the last common ancestor of the Anthozoans. In other words, they figured out how long ago the first Anthozoan evolved.

Finally, "estimate evolutionary time between each pair of these species" means that the researchers used this information to figure out how long ago each pair of Anthozoan species shared a common ancestor.

So, in summary, this reference is about using a specific study to estimate how long ago different Anthozoan species evolved and how they are related to each other. We hope this explanation helps!
==============================
Using a larger dataset of six Anthozoan GFPs and species for which we have accurate MYA to last common ancestors and GFP sequence identities, we construct a simple estimator that correlates sequence identity between FPs to MY of evolutionary time between the species (Fig. $4 \mathrm{H}$ ) to calibrate against natural evolution.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a study that used a larger dataset of six Anthozoan GFPs and species to construct a simple estimator that correlates sequence identity between FPs to MY of evolutionary time between the species.

First, let's break down what some of these terms mean. Anthozoan GFPs are a type of fluorescent protein found in certain species of coral. MY stands for "million years" and is a unit of time used in evolutionary biology.

The study used a larger dataset of six Anthozoan GFPs and species for which they had accurate MYA to last common ancestors and GFP sequence identities. MYA stands for "million years ago" and refers to the time when two species shared a common ancestor. GFP sequence identities refer to how similar the genetic sequences of the fluorescent proteins are between different species.

Using this dataset, the researchers were able to construct a simple estimator that correlates sequence identity between FPs to MY of evolutionary time between the species. This means that they were able to use the similarity of the fluorescent protein sequences to estimate how long ago the species shared a common ancestor.

The researchers then used this estimator to calibrate against natural evolution. Calibration means that they were able to use this estimator to better understand how the fluorescent protein sequences have evolved over time.

Overall, this study provides a useful tool for understanding the evolution of fluorescent proteins in different species. Thank you for watching!
==============================
Based on this analysis we estimate esmGFP represents an equivalent of over 500 million years of evolution from the closest protein that has been found in nature.

------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a fascinating scientific discovery that has recently been made.

Scientists have been studying a protein called esmGFP, which is a type of fluorescent protein that is commonly used in research. Through their analysis, they have estimated that esmGFP represents an equivalent of over 500 million years of evolution from the closest protein that has been found in nature.

Now, what does this mean exactly? Well, let's break it down.

First, it's important to understand that evolution is a process that occurs over a very long period of time. It's the gradual change in the characteristics of a species over generations, as a result of natural selection and other factors.

In this case, scientists have found that esmGFP has evolved over a period of 500 million years. This means that it has undergone many changes and adaptations over this time, in order to become the protein that it is today.

So why is this significant? Well, it's important for a few reasons.

Firstly, it helps us to better understand the process of evolution itself. By studying how esmGFP has evolved over such a long period of time, we can gain insights into how other proteins and species have evolved as well.

Secondly, it has practical applications in the field of biotechnology. EsmGFP is a very useful tool for researchers, as it allows them to track the movement and behavior of cells in real-time. By understanding how it has evolved, we can potentially improve its properties and make it even more useful for research purposes.

So there you have it! EsmGFP represents an incredible example of the power of evolution, and its discovery has important implications for both science and biotechnology. Thanks for watching!
