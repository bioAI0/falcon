 ESM3 reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins. All three modalities are represented by tokens, and are input and output as separate tracks that are fused into a single latent space within the model. ESM3 is trained with a generative masked language modeling objective.

 [[ESM3]] is a bidirectional transformer. While extensive research has gone into creating specialized architectures and training objectives for proteins, we find that tokenization paired with a standard masked language modeling objective and the basic transformer architecture is highly effective for both representation learning and generative modeling. Sequence, structure, and function tracks are input as tokens, which are embedded and fused, then processed through a [[transformer]] architecture.

 [[ESM3]] models are trained at three scales: 1.4 billion, 7 billion, and 98 billion parameters. In a series of experiments to evaluate representation learning performance, we found that increasing depth had a greater response than increasing width. This led us to choose relatively deep networks for the final architectures, with the 98 billion parameter model incorporating 216 Transformer blocks.
