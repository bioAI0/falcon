 ESM3 is a language model that has been designed to understand and respond to complex prompts with varying compositions. It is capable of analyzing the context and structure of a prompt, and generating a response that is relevant and coherent.

One of the key features of ESM3 is its ability to handle prompts that contain multiple clauses or phrases. It can identify the main subject and verb of a sentence, and use this information to generate a response that is grammatically correct and semantically appropriate.

In addition, ESM3 is able to recognize and respond to prompts that contain different types of information, such as questions, statements, and commands. It can also handle prompts that contain references to previous statements or questions, and use this information to generate a response that is contextually relevant.

Overall, ESM3 is a powerful tool for generating responses to complex prompts with different compositions. Its ability to analyze and understand the structure and context of a prompt makes it an ideal choice for applications that require natural language processing and generation.###

 ESM3 is a program that can receive instructions from various input tracks, including sequence, structure coordinates, secondary structure (SS8), solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), and function keywords. These instructions can be used to prompt ESM3 to perform specific tasks or analyses. For example, the sequence input track can be used to prompt ESM3 to generate a protein sequence alignment, while the structure coordinates input track can be used to prompt ESM3 to calculate the distance between two atoms in a protein structure. The SS8 input track can be used to prompt ESM3 to identify regions of a protein that are likely to be helical or sheet-like, while the SASA input track can be used to prompt ESM3 to calculate the surface area of a protein that is exposed to solvent. Finally, the function keywords input track can be used to prompt ESM3 to identify proteins that are involved in specific biological processes or pathways. Overall, the ability to prompt ESM3 with instructions from multiple input tracks makes it a versatile tool for protein analysis and prediction.

 This means that the prompts can be defined at different levels of detail, ranging from the basic building blocks of a system to the overall purpose and structure of the system. The generative model is used to find a solution that is consistent with the prompts and takes into account the various levels of abstraction. This approach allows for a more flexible and comprehensive way of defining and solving problems.###

 ESM3 is a system that is designed to follow prompts in each of the tracks independently. This means that it has the ability to understand and respond to different types of prompts that are specific to each track. For example, if there is a prompt related to customer service, ESM3 will be able to understand and respond to that prompt in a way that is appropriate for customer service. Similarly, if there is a prompt related to technical support, ESM3 will be able to understand and respond to that prompt in a way that is appropriate for technical support.

To evaluate ESM3's ability to follow prompts in each of the tracks independently, we would need to test it in different scenarios and see how well it performs. We would need to provide different types of prompts and see if ESM3 is able to understand and respond to them correctly. We would also need to evaluate its performance over time to see if it is able to consistently follow prompts in each of the tracks independently.

Overall, ESM3's ability to follow prompts in each of the tracks independently is an important aspect of its functionality, and it is something that we would need to evaluate carefully to ensure that it is working as intended.

 I can explain that the resulting generations were evaluated for consistency with the prompt and foldability, which means that the generated structures were checked to see if they matched the given prompt and if they were physically possible to fold. The confidence of the structure prediction TM-score (pTM) under ESMFold was also evaluated, which is a measure of how accurately the predicted structure matches the true structure. The higher the pTM score, the more confident we can be that the predicted structure is correct.
User:

 The consistency metrics are used to evaluate the performance of a track in a specific task. The constrained site RMSD (cRMSD) measures the difference between the prompt coordinates and the corresponding coordinates in the generation. The SS3 accuracy measures the fraction of residues where three-class secondary structure between the prompt and generations match. The SASA spearman $\rho$ measures the correlation between the SASA prompt and the corresponding region of the generation. Finally, the keyword recovery measures the fraction of prompt keywords recovered by InterProScan. These metrics are used to assess the consistency of the track in terms of its ability to accurately reproduce the prompt coordinates, secondary structure, SASA, and keywords.
User:

 The statement suggests that the ESM3 system is capable of identifying solutions that adhere to the given prompt and have a high level of confidence in their predicted structures, as indicated by a pTM value greater than 0.8. This is demonstrated in Figure 2A, which likely shows a graph or chart illustrating the performance of ESM3 in this regard.

 Unconditional generations refer to the process of generating a set of data or samples that accurately represent the distribution of natural proteins. This is typically done using statistical methods and algorithms that take into account the variability and complexity of protein structures and functions.

The goal of unconditional generation is to create a dataset that is representative of the true distribution of proteins in nature, without any biases or assumptions. This is important for a variety of applications, such as drug discovery, protein engineering, and understanding the evolution of proteins.

To achieve unconditional generation, researchers may use techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, which involves randomly sampling from a probability distribution to generate a set of data that reflects the underlying distribution. Other methods may include deep learning algorithms or generative models that can learn the complex patterns and structures of natural proteins.

Overall, unconditional generation is a powerful tool for studying and understanding the diversity and complexity of natural proteins, and has the potential to drive important advances in many fields of science and medicine.###

 Certainly! The researchers observed that the ESM3 model was able to accurately follow prompts, which led them to hypothesize that prompting could be used to generate proteins that differ from those found in nature. Essentially, by providing specific prompts or instructions to the model, it may be possible to guide it towards generating proteins with unique properties or functions that are not typically found in natural proteins. This could have important implications for fields such as biotechnology and drug discovery, where the ability to design and engineer novel proteins with specific properties is highly desirable.

 Certainly! When we talk about testing the ability of a model to follow out-of-distribution prompts, we are essentially trying to determine how well the model can handle inputs that are different from the ones it was trained on. 

For example, let's say we have a language model that was trained on a large corpus of text data related to sports. If we want to test its ability to follow out-of-distribution prompts, we might give it a prompt related to a completely different topic, such as cooking or politics. 

If the model is able to generate coherent and relevant responses to these prompts, it suggests that it has a good understanding of the underlying structure of language and can generalize well to new contexts. On the other hand, if the model struggles to generate meaningful responses, it may indicate that it has overfit to the training data and is not able to handle inputs that are significantly different from what it has seen before.

Overall, testing the ability of a model to follow out-of-distribution prompts is an important step in evaluating its performance and ensuring that it is robust enough to handle a wide range of inputs.

 The model is able to generate coherent globular structures with a high mean pTM value of 0.85 +/- 0.03. However, the distribution of similarities to the training set has shifted towards more novel structures, with an average sequence identity to the nearest training set protein of less than 20% and a mean TM-score of 0.48 +/- 0.09. This suggests that the model is able to generate structures that are not simply copies of the training set, but rather novel and unique structures.
User:

 To evaluate the capability of a model to apply its knowledge to structures that are not present in the training dataset, we utilize secondary structure prompts that are derived from a set of artificial symmetric protein designs. These designs are different from the natural proteins that were used in the training dataset. This approach allows us to assess the model's ability to generalize its knowledge to new and unseen structures. The details of this process can be found in Appendix A.3.8.
User:

 The ESM3 model is capable of producing high confidence generations with low sequence and structure similarity to proteins in the training set. This means that the model can generate protein sequences and structures that are highly distinct from those that exist in nature. The model achieves this by producing generations with a pTM greater than 0.8 and a pLDDT greater than 0.8, while maintaining a sequence identity of less than 20% and a TM-score of 0.52 ± 0.10. These results suggest that the ESM3 model can be a valuable tool for generating novel protein sequences and structures.

It has the ability to analyze and interpret prompts from various sources and at different levels of abstraction. This means that it can understand prompts that are highly technical or abstract in nature, and respond accordingly.

Furthermore, ESM3 is able to compose prompts from different tracks, which means that it can take information from multiple sources and combine them into a single prompt. This allows it to provide more comprehensive and accurate responses to user queries.

Overall, ESM3 is a highly sophisticated system that is capable of handling complex prompts and providing accurate and helpful responses to users. Its ability to analyze and interpret prompts from different sources and at different levels of abstraction makes it a valuable tool for experts in various fields.

 I can explain that the esm3 model is being evaluated for its ability to solve for the spatial coordination of individual atoms, particularly in cases where there is tertiary coordination between residues that are far apart in the sequence. this is important for understanding catalytic centers and ligand binding sites, which are crucial for many biological processes. by evaluating the model's performance in these areas, researchers can determine its usefulness for predicting protein structures and functions.

 ESM3 is a system that has the ability to follow prompts from each of its input tracks. This means that it can receive instructions or guidance from multiple sources and respond accordingly. The density of faithfulness to prompting for each of the tracks refers to the level of accuracy and reliability with which ESM3 follows the prompts from each input track.

The system has been designed to achieve consistency with the prompt, which means that it can accurately follow the instructions given to it. Additionally, ESM3 has a high foldability (pTM), which means that it can adapt to changes in the prompts or instructions given to it. This makes it a highly flexible and versatile system that can be used in a variety of applications.

Overall, ESM3 is a powerful tool that can help experts achieve their goals by providing accurate and reliable responses to prompts from multiple input tracks. Its high level of consistency and foldability make it an ideal choice for a wide range of applications.

 ESM3 is a language model that can be used to generate proteins with different structures and sequences compared to natural proteins. This is achieved by prompting the model to generate proteins that are more novel in nature. The model can be trained using out-of-distribution natural structures or computationally designed symmetric proteins. The resulting prompted generations (blue) are more novel compared to unconditional generations (red). This means that the model can be used to generate proteins with unique properties that are not found in natural proteins.

 ESM3 is a tool that can generate creative solutions to complex prompts. It does this by combining atomic level motifs with high level instructions that are specified through keywords or secondary structure. The tool is able to demonstrate its fidelity to the prompt by comparing its output to a reference structure (for keyword prompts) or by calculating the all-atom RMSD to the prompted structure (for atomic coordination prompts).

One of the key features of ESM3 is that the solutions it generates are different from the scaffolds where the motif was derived. This is demonstrated by the median TM-score of $0.36 \pm 0.14$. Additionally, for many motifs, such as serotonin, calcium, protease inhibitor, and Mcl-1 inhibitor binding sites, ESM3 was unable to find any significant similarity to other proteins that contain the same motif.

Overall, ESM3 is a powerful tool for generating creative solutions to complex prompts, and its ability to generate unique solutions makes it a valuable resource for researchers and experts in the field.

 D: An example of especially creative behavior is the ESM3 protein, which is able to compress a serine protease by 33% without disrupting its active site structure. This is a remarkable feat of protein engineering that demonstrates the potential for designing more efficient and effective enzymes for various applications.###

 The text describes a process where a combination of motifs and scaffolds are used to generate samples until certain criteria are met. These criteria include a coordinate root mean square deviation (cRMSD) of less than 1.5 angstroms, a fold level prompt with a TM value greater than 0.6, and a secondary structure prompt with SS3 accuracy greater than 80%. The process is considered successful if these criteria are met with high confidence, as indicated by a pTM value greater than 0.8 and a pLDDT value greater than 0.8. The results show that ESM3 is effective in solving a variety of these tasks.

 The statement suggests that the process being discussed is able to achieve a certain result without relying on the original structure or framework of the motif. The TM-score mentioned is a measure of how similar two protein structures are, with a score of 1 indicating a perfect match and lower scores indicating increasing levels of dissimilarity. The median TM-score of 0.40 +/- 0.10 suggests that the structures being compared are not very similar, but still have some degree of similarity. The reference protein mentioned is likely a known structure that is being used as a comparison point. The Appendix A.3.9 likely refers to a section in a research paper or report where more details about the methodology and results can be found.

 In certain situations, the scaffolds are derived from pre-existing proteins that possess comparable motifs. For instance, the ESM3-designed alpha-helical scaffold for the zinc-binding motif exhibits a high degree of similarity to $\mathrm{Ni}_{2+}$-binding proteins, as demonstrated by PDB: 5DQW, 5DQY; Fig. 2C, row 3 column 1.

 Foldseek is a computational tool that is used to predict protein structures based on sequence similarity. It works by comparing the query sequence to a database of known protein structures and identifying regions of similarity. However, in some cases, Foldseek may not be able to find significant similarity to other proteins that contain the same motif. This could be due to several reasons, such as the motif being highly divergent or the protein containing the motif being structurally unique. In such cases, other computational tools or experimental techniques may be needed to determine the structure and function of the protein.
User:

 In some instances, a motif has been incorporated into distinct structural folds. For example, a protease inhibitor binding site motif has been found in a beta-barrel structure that is more similar to a membrane-bound copper transporter, as seen in PDB: 7PGE (Fig. 2C, row 3 column 3).
User:

 The scaffold is a structure that supports the design and development of a protein. In this case, the scaffold is used to create an alpha/beta protein that can bind to the Mcl-1 inhibitor binding motif. The scaffold is unique because it has low structural similarity to all known proteins in the PDB, ESMAtlas, and the AlphaFold databases. This means that the scaffold is a novel structure that has not been seen before. The TM-score, which is a measure of structural similarity, is less than 0.5, indicating that the scaffold is significantly different from other known structures.
User:

 The generated solutions have a high level of designability, which means that they can be confidently recovered to their original structure after inverse folding with ESMFold. This is indicated by the median pTM value of 0.80 +/- 0.08 and the scTM value of 0.96 +/- 0.04, as shown in Appendix A.3.9. This suggests that the solutions are highly reliable and can be used for further analysis or experimentation.

 I can explain that prompt engineering is a process of designing and refining prompts to elicit specific types of responses from users. in the context of creative responses, prompt engineering involves crafting prompts that encourage users to think outside the box and generate unique and imaginative ideas.

through experiments with prompt engineering, researchers have found that certain types of prompts can lead to especially creative responses. for example, prompts that are open-ended and allow for multiple interpretations tend to generate more creative responses than prompts that are highly specific and narrow in scope.

additionally, prompts that incorporate unexpected or unusual elements can also stimulate creativity. for instance, a prompt that asks users to imagine a world where gravity is reversed or a prompt that challenges users to come up with a story using only six words can inspire highly creative responses.

overall, prompt engineering is a valuable tool for eliciting creative responses from users, and researchers continue to explore new and innovative ways to design prompts that foster creativity.

 Protein compression is a technique used in bioinformatics to reduce the size of protein data sets while preserving their essential information. This is achieved by identifying and removing redundant or irrelevant data points, such as highly similar sequences or sequences with low quality scores. The resulting compressed data set can be used for various applications, such as protein structure prediction, functional annotation, and drug discovery.

For example, in a study published in the journal Bioinformatics, researchers used protein compression to analyze a large set of protein sequences from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). They developed a novel algorithm called PDB-REDUCE, which identifies and removes redundant sequences based on their structural similarity. The compressed data set was then used to predict protein structures with high accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of protein compression in improving computational efficiency and accuracy.

Overall, protein compression is a valuable tool for managing and analyzing large protein data sets, and it has the potential to accelerate progress in various fields of biology and medicine.

 I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I am not able to provide visual aids or diagrams. However, I can explain the process of starting from a natural trypsin (PDB $1 \mathrm{Y} 3 \mathrm{~V}$ ) and prompting with the sequence and coordinates of the catalytic triad as well as functional keywords describing trypsin, but reducing the overall generation length by a third (from 223 to 150 residues).

The process involves using the natural trypsin (PDB $1 \mathrm{Y} 3 \mathrm{~V}$ ) as a starting point and then modifying it by reducing the overall length of the sequence by a third. This is done by removing some of the amino acid residues from the sequence, while still maintaining the catalytic triad and other functional keywords that describe trypsin.

The catalytic triad is a group of three amino acid residues that are essential for the enzymatic activity of trypsin. These residues are typically located in close proximity to each other in the protein structure and work together to catalyze the hydrolysis of peptide bonds.

By reducing the overall length of the sequence, the resulting protein may have different properties and functions compared to the natural trypsin. However, it may still retain some of the key features and activities of trypsin, such as its ability to cleave peptide bonds.

Overall, this process involves modifying the natural trypsin protein to create a new variant with different properties and functions, while still retaining some of the key features of the original protein.

 The statement suggests that the protein ESM3 is able to maintain the coordination of its active site and overall fold with high designability, despite having a shorter sequence length and being specified only by a function keyword prompt. The coordination of the active site is measured by the cRMSD, which is 0.73 Å, indicating a high level of similarity between the predicted and actual structures. The overall fold is also well-maintained, with a high designability score of pTM 0.84 and scTM mean 0.97, indicating that the protein is highly stable and functional. The fact that these properties are maintained despite the reduction in sequence length and the lack of detailed structural information suggests that ESM3 is a highly efficient and adaptable protein.
