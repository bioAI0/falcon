ESM3 reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins
------------------------------
 This sentence is about a computer program called ESM3, which is designed to analyze and understand proteins. Proteins are important molecules in our bodies that perform many functions, such as building and repairing tissues, transporting molecules, and catalyzing chemical reactions. ESM3 uses complex algorithms to study the sequence (the order of amino acids that make up the protein), structure (the 3D shape of the protein), and function (what the protein does in the body) of proteins. This information can be used to better understand diseases and develop new treatments.
==============================
 All three modalities are represented by tokens, and are input and output as separate tracks that are fused into a single latent space within the model
------------------------------
 This sentence is describing a model that uses three different types of data, called modalities, and combines them into a single space within the model. The modalities are represented by tokens, which are like symbols or units of data. These tokens are input into the model and then output as separate tracks, which means they are processed separately but still connected to the overall model. Finally, the separate tracks are fused together into a single latent space, which is a hidden layer within the model that combines all the information from the different modalities. This allows the model to make more accurate predictions or decisions based on the combined data.

==============================
 ESM3 is trained with a generative masked language modeling objective:

A random mask $m$ is applied to the tokens $x$ describing the protein, and the model is supervised to predict the identity of the tokens that have been masked
------------------------------
 The sentence is describing a process called "masked language modeling" which is used to train a model called ESM3. The model is being trained to predict the identity of certain tokens (words or phrases) that have been randomly masked (hidden) in a description of a protein. The goal is to help the model learn how to understand and describe proteins more accurately.
==============================
 During training, the mask is sampled from a noise schedule so that ESM3 sees many different combinations of masked sequence, structure, and function, and predicts completions of any combination of the modalities from any other
------------------------------
 During training, the mask is randomly selected from a set of noisy data, which allows the ESM3 model to learn from a variety of different combinations of masked sequences, structures, and functions. This helps the model to accurately predict the completion of any combination of modalities from any other.
==============================
 This differs from the classical masked language modeling (28) in that the supervision is applied across all possible masking rates rather than a single fixed masking rate
------------------------------
 This sentence is discussing a technique called masked language modeling, which is used in natural language processing. The classical approach to masked language modeling involves using a fixed masking rate, which means that a certain percentage of words in a sentence are randomly replaced with a special token. However, the approach being discussed in this sentence is different because it applies supervision across all possible masking rates, which means that the model is trained on a range of different masking rates instead of just one fixed rate. This can lead to better performance in certain tasks, such as language modeling and machine translation.
==============================
 This supervision factorizes the probability distribution over all possible predictions of the next token given any combination of previous tokens, ensuring that tokens can be generated in any order from any starting point (29-31)
------------------------------
 This sentence is about a technique called "supervision" that helps generate text in a flexible way. It means that the probability of predicting the next word in a sentence is calculated based on all possible combinations of previous words. This allows the system to generate text in any order, starting from any point. The numbers 29-31 refer to the specific pages in a research paper where this technique is discussed in more detail.
==============================

To generate from ESM3, tokens are iteratively sampled
------------------------------
 This sentence is about a process called "iterative sampling" that is used to generate something from a system called ESM3. The process involves selecting small pieces of information, called "tokens," one at a time, and repeating this selection process multiple times. This is done to create a larger set of information or data.
==============================
 Starting from a sequence of all mask tokens, tokens can be sampled one at a time, or in parallel, in any order, until all tokens are fully unmasked (Fig
------------------------------
 This sentence is describing a process where a sequence of tokens (which are like building blocks of language) are being revealed or "unmasked" one at a time or in parallel (meaning multiple tokens can be revealed at the same time). The order in which the tokens are revealed doesn't matter, as long as all of them are eventually revealed. The process is illustrated in a figure called Fig.

 Masking is applied independently to sequence, structure, and function tracks, which enables generation from any combination of empty, partial, or complete inputs
------------------------------
 This sentence is talking about a process called "masking" which is used to generate different types of tracks (sequence, structure, and function). The process can be applied to any combination of inputs, whether they are empty, partial, or complete. This means that the masking process is flexible and can be used in different situations depending on the available inputs.
==============================
 ESM3's training objective is also effective for representation learning
------------------------------
 The sentence means that the goal of training ESM3 (a type of machine learning model) is not only to improve its performance on a specific task, but also to help it learn how to represent data in a more useful way. This is important because better representation learning can lead to better performance on a variety of tasks.
==============================
 We choose a noise schedule that balances generative capabilities with representation learning (Appendix A
------------------------------
 The sentence is discussing a process where a noise schedule is being selected. The goal of this selection is to find a balance between two things: generative capabilities and representation learning. The details of this process can be found in Appendix A.

Tokenization enables efficient reasoning over structure
------------------------------
 Tokenization is a process of breaking down a sentence or a document into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be words, phrases, or even individual characters. By tokenizing a text, it becomes easier to analyze and understand its structure. This can be useful in various applications such as natural language processing, where the goal is to extract meaning from human language. Efficient reasoning over structure means that once the text is tokenized, it can be analyzed more quickly and accurately, allowing for faster and more effective processing of the information contained within it.
==============================
 Protein structures are tokenized by a discrete auto-encoder (32), which is trained to compress the high dimensional space of three-dimensional structure into discrete tokens (Fig
------------------------------
 The sentence is discussing a process called "tokenization" which involves breaking down complex data into smaller, more manageable pieces. In this case, the data being tokenized are protein structures. The process is done using a type of machine learning algorithm called a "discrete auto-encoder" which is trained to compress the high dimensional space of three-dimensional structure into discrete tokens. The figure referenced in the sentence likely shows a visual representation of this process.

==============================
 The mechanism operates in local reference frames defined by the bond geometry at each amino acid, and allows local frames to interact globally through a transformation into the global frame (Appendix A
------------------------------
 The sentence is describing a process that involves a mechanism that works within specific reference frames, which are determined by the structure of amino acids. This mechanism allows for interaction between these local frames on a larger scale, by transforming them into a global frame. The details of this transformation are explained in Appendix A.

------------------------------
 This sentence is discussing a mechanism that can be easily implemented using the same basic building blocks as a process called "attention" (which is a common technique in machine learning). The mechanism is also able to handle larger amounts of data without becoming too slow or difficult to use.
==============================
 The local structural neighborhoods around each amino acid are encoded into a sequence of discrete tokens, one for each amino acid
------------------------------
 This sentence is describing a process where the structure of a protein is being analyzed. The structure of a protein is made up of amino acids, and the sentence is saying that the local structure around each amino acid is being represented by a sequence of discrete tokens. These tokens are like symbols or codes that represent the structure of the protein. Each amino acid in the protein is assigned a token, which helps to describe the overall structure of the protein.
==============================


When predicting or generating protein structure, structure tokens output by ESM3 are passed to the decoder, which reconstructs the all-atom structure
------------------------------
 This sentence is about a process used in protein research. It involves using a computer program called ESM3 to predict or generate the structure of a protein. The program outputs "structure tokens" which are then used by another program called the decoder to create a detailed, all-atom structure of the protein. This process helps researchers understand the shape and function of proteins, which is important for developing new drugs and treatments for diseases.
==============================
 The autoencoder is trained to encode and reconstruct atomic coordinates with a geometric loss that supervises the pairwise distances and relative orientations of bond vectors and normals (Appendix A
------------------------------
 The sentence is describing a process where a machine learning model called an autoencoder is being trained to encode and reconstruct atomic coordinates. This means that the model is being taught to take in information about the positions of atoms and then output a representation of that information that can be used to recreate the original atomic coordinates.

The training process involves using a geometric loss function, which is a mathematical formula that measures how well the model is able to accurately predict the distances and orientations between pairs of atoms. This loss function is used to adjust the parameters of the autoencoder so that it can better learn to encode and reconstruct atomic coordinates.

The Appendix A mentioned in the sentence likely contains more detailed information about the specific geometric loss function being used in this training process.

 S3), enabling representation of structure at the input and output with atomic accuracy
------------------------------
 This sentence is discussing a technology called S3, which stands for "Structure-based Semantic Search System." It is a system that allows for very precise and accurate representation of structures, both at the input (when data is entered into the system) and output (when the system produces results). This means that the system can accurately represent the structure of molecules, proteins, or other complex structures with atomic accuracy. This level of precision is important for many scientific and medical applications, such as drug discovery and disease research.

We also find that providing ESM3 direct access to atomic coordinates in the input via a geometric attention projection into the transformer improves the response to atomic coordinate prompts
------------------------------
 This sentence is discussing a research finding related to a machine learning model called ESM3. The researchers found that by giving the model direct access to atomic coordinates (which are specific locations of atoms in a molecule), they were able to improve the model's ability to respond to prompts related to atomic coordinates. This was achieved by using a technique called geometric attention projection into the transformer, which is a type of neural network architecture used in machine learning. Overall, this finding suggests that providing more specific information to the model can improve its performance in certain tasks.
==============================
 ESM3 can be conditioned on either or both of tokenized structure and atomic coordinates
