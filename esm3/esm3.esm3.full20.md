ESM3 reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the reference "ESM3 reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins."

First, let's break down what ESM3 stands for. ESM3 is a protein structure prediction software that uses a combination of sequence and structure information to predict the 3D structure of proteins.

Now, let's talk about what it means to reason over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins. Proteins are made up of a sequence of amino acids, and the sequence of these amino acids determines the protein's structure and function. The structure of a protein refers to its 3D shape, which is critical for its function. The function of a protein refers to its role in the body, such as catalyzing chemical reactions or transporting molecules.

ESM3 uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the sequence and structure of proteins to predict their function. This is important because understanding the function of proteins can help us develop new drugs and treatments for diseases.

In summary, ESM3 is a protein structure prediction software that uses sequence and structure information to predict the function of proteins. This is important for developing new drugs and treatments for diseases.

All three modalities are represented by tokens, and are input and output as separate tracks that are fused into a single latent space within the model.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, I'm here to help you understand it.

The concept we're going to be discussing is the idea of "modalities" and how they are represented in a model. Specifically, we're going to be talking about how all three modalities are represented by tokens, and are input and output as separate tracks that are fused into a single latent space within the model.

So, what do we mean by "modalities"? Well, in this context, modalities refer to different types of data that can be used to represent information. For example, in a video, the modalities might include the visual information (what you see), the audio information (what you hear), and the text information (what you read).

Now, when we talk about these modalities being represented by tokens, what we mean is that each modality is broken down into smaller units that can be processed by the model. For example, in the case of the visual modality, the tokens might be individual pixels or small groups of pixels.

Once these tokens have been created, they are input into the model as separate tracks. This means that each modality is processed separately, with its own set of parameters and weights.

Finally, these separate tracks are fused together into a single latent space within the model. This latent space is a higher-dimensional representation of the data that captures the underlying structure and relationships between the different modalities.

So, to summarize, all three modalities are represented by tokens, and are input and output as separate tracks that are fused into a single latent space within the model. This allows the model to process and understand the different types of data that make up the input, and to generate more accurate and meaningful outputs.

ESM3 is trained with a generative masked language modeling objective:
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a concept called ESM3 and how it's trained with a generative masked language modeling objective.

First, let's define what ESM3 is. ESM3 stands for "Electronically Scanned Microscopy Model 3." It's a type of microscope that uses electrons instead of light to create images of very small objects, like cells or molecules.

Now, let's talk about the generative masked language modeling objective. This is a type of machine learning technique that's used to train ESM3. Essentially, it involves feeding the microscope a large amount of data, like images of cells or molecules, and then having it generate new images based on that data.

The "masked" part of the objective means that certain parts of the images are hidden from the microscope during training. This forces it to learn how to fill in the missing information and generate more accurate images.

So, in summary, ESM3 is a type of microscope that uses machine learning techniques like generative masked language modeling to create highly detailed images of very small objects.

A random mask $m$ is applied to the tokens $x$ describing the protein, and the model is supervised to predict the identity of the tokens that have been masked.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but I promise to explain it in a way that's easy to understand.

So, let's start with the basics. When we talk about proteins, we often use tokens to describe them. These tokens are like building blocks that make up the protein, and they can be represented by letters or numbers.

Now, imagine that we want to predict the identity of these tokens. That's where a random mask comes in. A mask is like a filter that we apply to the tokens, and it randomly selects some of them to hide.

Once we've applied the mask, we can then use a model to predict the identity of the tokens that have been hidden. This is called supervised learning, because we're training the model to recognize patterns in the data.

So, to summarize, we're using a random mask to hide some of the tokens that describe a protein, and then we're using a model to predict the identity of those tokens. This is a powerful technique that can help us better understand the structure and function of proteins.

I hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them below. Thanks for watching!
==============================
During training, the mask is sampled from a noise schedule so that ESM3 sees many different combinations of masked sequence, structure, and function, and predicts completions of any combination of the modalities from any other.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, we'll break it down for you.

The concept we're talking about is called "masked sequence, structure, and function prediction." Now, what does that mean exactly?

Well, during training, a model called ESM3 is exposed to a variety of different combinations of masked sequences, structures, and functions. This means that the model is presented with incomplete data and is tasked with predicting what the missing information might be.

For example, let's say we have a sequence of DNA that is partially masked, meaning some of the letters are missing. ESM3 would be trained to predict what those missing letters might be based on the surrounding sequence.

But it's not just limited to DNA sequences. ESM3 can also predict missing information in protein structures and functions.

So, in summary, ESM3 is trained to predict missing information in a variety of different modalities, including sequences, structures, and functions. This allows it to make more accurate predictions and be a valuable tool in the field of bioinformatics.

We hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions or would like to learn more, please leave a comment below. Thanks for watching!

This differs from the classical masked language modeling (28) in that the supervision is applied across all possible masking rates rather than a single fixed masking rate.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept called masked language modeling.

In traditional masked language modeling, a single fixed masking rate is used to determine which words in a sentence are hidden or "masked" from the model. This means that the model is only trained on a specific subset of the data, which can limit its ability to generalize to new and unseen data.

However, the approach we're discussing today differs from this traditional method in that it applies supervision across all possible masking rates. This means that the model is trained on a much larger and more diverse set of data, which can lead to better performance and more accurate predictions.

So, in summary, this approach to masked language modeling allows for a more comprehensive and diverse training set, which can ultimately lead to better performance and more accurate predictions.

Thank you for watching, and we hope this explanation has been helpful!

This supervision factorizes the probability distribution over all possible predictions of the next token given any combination of previous tokens, ensuring that tokens can be generated in any order from any starting point (29-31).
To generate from ESM3, tokens are iteratively sampled.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept called "supervision factorization" and how it relates to generating text using a model called ESM3.

First, let's define what we mean by "supervision factorization." Essentially, this means that the model is able to break down the probability distribution of all possible predictions for the next token in a sequence, given any combination of previous tokens. This is important because it allows the model to generate tokens in any order, starting from any point in the sequence.

Now, let's talk about how this relates to ESM3. ESM3 is a language model that is able to generate text by iteratively sampling tokens. This means that the model starts with a sequence of tokens and then generates the next token in the sequence based on the probability distribution of all possible predictions.

By using supervision factorization, ESM3 is able to generate tokens in any order, starting from any point in the sequence. This is because the model is able to factorize the probability distribution of all possible predictions, which allows it to generate tokens in a flexible and efficient manner.

In summary, supervision factorization is a key concept in language modeling that allows models like ESM3 to generate text in any order, starting from any point in the sequence. By breaking down the probability distribution of all possible predictions, these models are able to generate text in a flexible and efficient manner.

Starting from a sequence of all mask tokens, tokens can be sampled one at a time, or in parallel, in any order, until all tokens are fully unmasked (Fig.1A).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but I promise it's actually quite simple once you break it down.

Let's start with the basics. In this context, a "token" refers to a small unit of data, like a word or a phrase. And "masking" means hiding or obscuring that data in some way.

So, when we talk about "sampling" tokens, we're essentially talking about revealing or uncovering them. And the idea is that we can do this in a variety of ways - one at a time, in parallel, or in any order we choose.

To make this a bit more concrete, let's imagine we have a sequence of tokens that are all currently masked or hidden. Our goal is to reveal them one by one until we have the full sequence.

We could start by revealing the first token, then the second, and so on, until we've revealed them all. This would be an example of sampling tokens one at a time.

Alternatively, we could reveal multiple tokens at once, in parallel. For example, we might reveal the first, third, and fifth tokens all at the same time, then the second, fourth, and sixth tokens in another batch.

Finally, we could reveal the tokens in any order we choose. We might start by revealing the third token, then the sixth, then the first, and so on.

The key takeaway here is that there are many different ways to reveal or uncover tokens, and the specific approach we choose will depend on our goals and the context of the data we're working with.

I hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions or would like to learn more, please don't hesitate to leave a comment below. Thanks for watching!

Masking is applied independently to sequence, structure, and function tracks, which enables generation from any combination of empty, partial, or complete inputs.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept called masking in relation to sequence, structure, and function tracks.

First, let's define what we mean by masking. In this context, masking refers to the process of selectively hiding or revealing certain parts of a track. This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as to focus on a specific region of interest or to remove unwanted noise.

Now, let's talk about how masking is applied to sequence, structure, and function tracks. These tracks are all different types of data that can be used to analyze biological sequences, such as DNA or protein sequences.

Sequence tracks contain information about the order of nucleotides or amino acids in a sequence. Structure tracks contain information about the three-dimensional structure of a molecule, such as a protein. Function tracks contain information about the biological function of a molecule, such as its role in a metabolic pathway.

When we apply masking to these tracks, we can selectively hide or reveal certain parts of the data. For example, we might want to mask out regions of a sequence that are known to be highly variable, or we might want to mask out regions of a structure that are poorly resolved.

The important thing to note is that masking can be applied independently to each type of track. This means that we can generate data from any combination of empty, partial, or complete inputs. For example, we might have a complete sequence track, a partial structure track, and an empty function track. By applying masking to each of these tracks independently, we can generate a more complete picture of the biological system we're studying.

So, that's a brief overview of masking in relation to sequence, structure, and function tracks. I hope this has been helpful! If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them in the comments section below. Thanks for watching!

ESM3's training objective is also effective for representation learning.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about ESM3's training objective and how it's effective for representation learning.

First, let's define what ESM3 is. ESM3 stands for Evolutionary Scale Modeling 3, which is a machine learning algorithm that can be used for a variety of tasks, such as classification, regression, and clustering.

Now, let's talk about representation learning. Representation learning is a type of machine learning where the goal is to learn a representation of the input data that can be used for other tasks. For example, if we have images of cats and dogs, we can use representation learning to learn a representation of these images that can be used to classify new images as either cats or dogs.

So, how does ESM3's training objective help with representation learning? Well, ESM3's training objective is designed to learn a hierarchical representation of the input data. This means that ESM3 can learn a representation of the data at different levels of abstraction, which can be useful for different tasks.

For example, if we have images of cats and dogs, ESM3 can learn a representation of the images at a low level of abstraction, such as edges and corners, as well as a representation at a higher level of abstraction, such as the overall shape of the animal.

This hierarchical representation can be useful for different tasks, such as classification, where the low-level representation can be used to identify specific features of the images, and the high-level representation can be used to classify the images as either cats or dogs.

In summary, ESM3's training objective is effective for representation learning because it can learn a hierarchical representation of the input data, which can be useful for different tasks.

We choose a noise schedule that balances generative capabilities with representation learning (Appendix A.2.2).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that might be a bit technical, but we'll do our best to explain it in a way that's easy to understand.

The concept we're talking about is called "noise schedule," and it's a technique used in machine learning to balance two important aspects of the learning process: generative capabilities and representation learning.

Let's start by defining these two terms. Generative capabilities refer to the ability of a machine learning model to generate new data that is similar to the data it was trained on. Representation learning, on the other hand, refers to the ability of a machine learning model to learn a good representation of the data it was trained on.

So, why do we need to balance these two aspects? Well, if we focus too much on generative capabilities, we might end up with a model that can generate new data, but doesn't actually learn anything useful about the data it was trained on. On the other hand, if we focus too much on representation learning, we might end up with a model that can learn a good representation of the data, but can't generate new data that's similar to the original data.

This is where the noise schedule comes in. A noise schedule is a way of gradually increasing the amount of noise in the data as the model is being trained. By doing this, we can encourage the model to focus on both generative capabilities and representation learning at different stages of the training process.

In our research, we've found that a specific noise schedule works well for balancing these two aspects (you can find more details about this in Appendix A.2.2). We hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them in the comments section below. Thanks for watching!

Tokenization enables efficient reasoning over structure.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to talk about tokenization and how it enables efficient reasoning over structure.

First, let's define what tokenization is. Tokenization is the process of breaking down a piece of text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be words, phrases, or even individual characters.

Now, why is tokenization important? Well, it allows us to analyze and understand the structure of a piece of text more easily. By breaking it down into smaller units, we can identify patterns and relationships between different parts of the text.

This is particularly useful in natural language processing (NLP), which is the field of study that focuses on how computers can understand and process human language. In NLP, tokenization is often used as a preprocessing step before other tasks like sentiment analysis or named entity recognition.

So, how does tokenization enable efficient reasoning over structure? Well, by breaking down a piece of text into smaller units, we can more easily identify the relationships between those units. This allows us to reason about the structure of the text more efficiently, which can be particularly useful when dealing with large amounts of data.

For example, imagine you have a dataset of customer reviews for a product. By tokenizing the reviews, you can identify common phrases or words that are used to describe the product. This can help you understand the overall sentiment of the reviews and identify any common issues or concerns that customers have.

In summary, tokenization is a powerful tool that enables efficient reasoning over structure in natural language processing. By breaking down text into smaller units, we can more easily identify patterns and relationships between different parts of the text, which can be particularly useful when dealing with large amounts of data.

Protein structures are tokenized by a discrete auto-encoder (32), which is trained to compress the high dimensional space of three-dimensional structure into discrete tokens (Fig.1C).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a fascinating topic in the field of protein structures.

Have you ever wondered how scientists study the complex three-dimensional structures of proteins? Well, it turns out that they use a technique called discrete auto-encoder.

In this technique, the high-dimensional space of three-dimensional protein structures is compressed into discrete tokens. This is done by training a model to learn the underlying patterns in the data and then using these patterns to generate a compressed representation of the protein structure.

The result is a set of discrete tokens that can be used to represent the protein structure in a more compact and efficient way. This is particularly useful for tasks like protein classification and prediction, where large amounts of data need to be processed quickly.

So, in summary, discrete auto-encoder is a powerful tool that allows scientists to study protein structures in a more efficient and effective way. We hope you found this explanation helpful! Thanks for watching!

We propose an invariant geometric attention mechanism to efficiently process three-dimensional structure.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a new technology called "invariant geometric attention mechanism." This technology is designed to help process three-dimensional structures more efficiently.

Now, you might be wondering what that means exactly. Well, let's break it down.

First, let's talk about "invariant." This means that the technology is able to work with different types of data without needing to be adjusted or changed. So, no matter what kind of three-dimensional structure you're working with, this technology can handle it.

Next, let's talk about "geometric." This refers to the fact that the technology is able to work with shapes and structures in a very precise way. It can analyze the angles, curves, and other features of a three-dimensional structure to help you understand it better.

Finally, let's talk about "attention mechanism." This means that the technology is able to focus on specific parts of a three-dimensional structure that are most important. It can help you identify key features and understand how they relate to the rest of the structure.

So, when you put all of these things together, you get an invariant geometric attention mechanism. This technology is designed to help you process three-dimensional structures more efficiently, so you can get more done in less time.

The mechanism operates in local reference frames defined by the bond geometry at each amino acid, and allows local frames to interact globally through a transformation into the global frame (Appendix A.1.6).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that might seem a bit complicated at first, but don't worry, I'm here to help you understand it.

The concept we're going to be discussing is the mechanism that operates in local reference frames defined by the bond geometry at each amino acid, and allows local frames to interact globally through a transformation into the global frame.

Now, I know that sounds like a mouthful, but let's break it down into simpler terms.

First, let's talk about what a reference frame is. A reference frame is simply a way of describing the position and orientation of an object in space. In this case, we're talking about the position and orientation of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins.

Now, let's talk about local reference frames. A local reference frame is a way of describing the position and orientation of an amino acid relative to its neighboring amino acids. This is important because the way that amino acids are arranged in a protein determines its shape and function.

So, when we talk about the mechanism that operates in local reference frames defined by the bond geometry at each amino acid, we're talking about a process that takes into account the specific arrangement of amino acids in a protein.

But what about the global frame? The global frame is a way of describing the position and orientation of the entire protein in space. This is important because proteins interact with other molecules in their environment, and their shape and function are influenced by these interactions.

So, when we talk about allowing local frames to interact globally through a transformation into the global frame, we're talking about a process that takes into account both the specific arrangement of amino acids in a protein and the way that the protein interacts with its environment.

I hope that helps! If you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments below. Thanks for watching!

This mechanism can be efficiently realized through the same computational primitives as attention (33), and is readily scalable.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a mechanism that can be efficiently realized through the same computational primitives as attention. This mechanism is readily scalable and can be used to explain a reference to non-experts.

First, let's define what we mean by "computational primitives." These are basic building blocks of computation that can be used to create more complex algorithms. In the context of attention, these primitives refer to the mathematical operations used to calculate attention scores.

Now, let's talk about the mechanism itself. This mechanism is designed to help explain a reference to non-experts. It does this by breaking down complex concepts into simpler terms that are easier to understand.

For example, let's say you're trying to explain a complex scientific paper to someone who doesn't have a background in science. You could use this mechanism to break down the paper into smaller, more manageable parts. You could then explain each part in simpler terms, making it easier for the non-expert to understand.

Overall, this mechanism is a powerful tool for explaining complex concepts to non-experts. By using the same computational primitives as attention, it is efficient and readily scalable. So, the next time you need to explain a reference to someone who isn't an expert, consider using this mechanism to help break it down into simpler terms.

The local structural neighborhoods around each amino acid are encoded into a sequence of discrete tokens, one for each amino acid.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, we'll break it down for you.

The reference we're discussing today is about encoding the local structural neighborhoods around each amino acid into a sequence of discrete tokens, one for each amino acid.

Let's start by defining some terms. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, which are essential for many biological processes in our bodies. The structure of a protein is determined by the sequence of amino acids that make it up.

Now, when we talk about the local structural neighborhoods around each amino acid, we're referring to the way that the amino acids are arranged in space. This arrangement can affect the protein's function and stability.

So, how do we encode this information? Well, we use a sequence of discrete tokens, one for each amino acid. These tokens represent the different types of local structural neighborhoods that can be found around each amino acid.

By encoding this information in a sequence of tokens, we can analyze and compare the local structural neighborhoods of different proteins. This can help us understand how proteins work and how they can be modified to improve their function.

In summary, encoding the local structural neighborhoods around each amino acid into a sequence of discrete tokens is a powerful tool for studying proteins and their functions. We hope this explanation has been helpful! Thanks for watching.

When predicting or generating protein structure, structure tokens output by ESM3 are passed to the decoder, which reconstructs the all-atom structure.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a concept related to protein structure prediction and generation.

When predicting or generating protein structure, structure tokens output by ESM3 are passed to the decoder, which reconstructs the all-atom structure.

Let's break this down.

First, what is protein structure prediction and generation? This refers to the process of determining the three-dimensional structure of a protein, which is important for understanding its function and potential interactions with other molecules.

Now, what is ESM3? ESM3 stands for Evolutionary Scale Modeling 3, which is a deep learning model used for protein structure prediction and generation.

When ESM3 is used for this purpose, it outputs structure tokens. These tokens are essentially small pieces of information that represent different aspects of the protein structure.

These structure tokens are then passed to the decoder, which is another part of the ESM3 model. The decoder uses this information to reconstruct the all-atom structure of the protein.

In other words, the structure tokens provide the decoder with the necessary information to build a complete picture of the protein's structure.

So, in summary, when predicting or generating protein structure using ESM3, structure tokens are used to provide the decoder with the necessary information to reconstruct the all-atom structure of the protein.

I hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them below. Thanks for watching!

The autoencoder is trained to encode and reconstruct atomic coordinates with a geometric loss that supervises the pairwise distances and relative orientations of bond vectors and normals (Appendix A.1.7.3.1).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept called autoencoders and how they can be used to encode and reconstruct atomic coordinates.

First, let's define what an autoencoder is. An autoencoder is a type of neural network that is used for unsupervised learning. It takes in input data, encodes it into a compressed representation, and then decodes it back into its original form.

Now, let's talk about how this can be applied to atomic coordinates. The autoencoder is trained to encode and reconstruct atomic coordinates with a geometric loss that supervises the pairwise distances and relative orientations of bond vectors and normals.

What does this mean? Essentially, the autoencoder is being trained to learn the relationships between different atoms in a molecule. It's looking at the distances between atoms and the angles at which they are oriented relative to each other.

This is important because it allows us to better understand the structure of molecules and how they interact with each other. By using an autoencoder to encode and reconstruct atomic coordinates, we can gain insights into the underlying structure of molecules and potentially develop new drugs or materials.

So, that's a brief overview of autoencoders and how they can be used to encode and reconstruct atomic coordinates. If you're interested in learning more, be sure to check out the resources in the description below. Thanks for watching!

This tokenization delivers nearperfect reconstruction of protein structure ( $<0.3 \AA$ RMSD on CAMEO, Fig.S3), enabling representation of structure at the input and output with atomic accuracy.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a reference that talks about the tokenization of protein structure. Now, this might sound a bit complicated, but don't worry, we'll break it down for you.

First, let's define what tokenization means. In this context, it refers to the process of breaking down a protein structure into smaller, more manageable parts. These parts are called tokens, and they can be used to represent the structure of the protein.

Now, let's talk about the results of this tokenization. According to the reference, this process delivers near-perfect reconstruction of protein structure, with an RMSD (root mean square deviation) of less than 0.3 angstroms on CAMEO. This means that the tokenization process is able to accurately represent the structure of the protein, with very little deviation from the actual structure.

Finally, let's talk about what this means for the representation of protein structure. With this level of accuracy, we can represent the structure of proteins at the input and output with atomic accuracy. This means that we can create highly detailed models of protein structures, which can be used for a variety of applications, such as drug discovery and protein engineering.

So there you have it! Tokenization of protein structure is a powerful tool that allows us to accurately represent the structure of proteins, which can have a wide range of applications in the field of biotechnology. Thanks for watching!

We also find that providing ESM3 direct access to atomic coordinates in the input via a geometric attention projection into the transformer improves the response to atomic coordinate prompts.
------------------------------
 Hello everyone, and welcome to this video where we'll be discussing a recent development in the field of molecular dynamics simulations.

In particular, we'll be looking at a study that found a way to improve the response to atomic coordinate prompts in a model called ESM3.

Now, before we dive into the details, let's first define some terms. Molecular dynamics simulations are a type of computer simulation that allows us to study the motion and behavior of molecules over time. ESM3 is a specific model used in these simulations that has shown great promise in predicting the behavior of proteins and other biomolecules.

So, what exactly is an atomic coordinate prompt? Well, in molecular dynamics simulations, we often want to study the behavior of specific atoms or groups of atoms within a molecule. To do this, we can use prompts that specify the coordinates of these atoms.

Now, onto the study itself. The researchers found that by providing ESM3 with direct access to atomic coordinates in the input, they could improve the model's response to these prompts. Specifically, they used a technique called geometric attention projection into the transformer to achieve this.

In simpler terms, this means that they were able to give ESM3 a better understanding of the positions of atoms within a molecule, which in turn allowed the model to more accurately predict their behavior.

Overall, this is an exciting development in the field of molecular dynamics simulations, as it could lead to more accurate predictions of the behavior of biomolecules.

ESM3 can be conditioned on either or both of tokenized structure and atomic coordinates.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a concept called ESM3, which stands for Energy-based Structural Model 3. This is a tool used in the field of structural biology to predict the 3D structure of proteins.

Now, you might be wondering what it means when we say that ESM3 can be conditioned on either or both of tokenized structure and atomic coordinates. Let's break that down.

First, let's define what we mean by tokenized structure. In this context, a token is a small unit of information that represents a specific part of a protein's structure. For example, a token might represent a helix or a sheet. By tokenizing the structure, we're essentially breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

Atomic coordinates, on the other hand, refer to the precise location of each atom in the protein. This information is typically obtained through experimental techniques such as X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy.

So, when we say that ESM3 can be conditioned on either or both of tokenized structure and atomic coordinates, we're saying that the tool can use either or both of these types of information to make predictions about the protein's structure.

For example, if we only have tokenized structure information available, ESM3 can use that to make predictions about the protein's overall shape and topology. If we have both tokenized structure and atomic coordinates, ESM3 can use that information to make more detailed predictions about the precise location of each atom in the protein.

Overall, ESM3 is a powerful tool that can help us better understand the structure and function of proteins, which are essential for many biological processes in our bodies. We hope this explanation has been helpful! Thanks for watching.

We supplement these structure representations with coarse grained tokens encoding secondary structure state (SS8) and solvent accessible surface area (SASA).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to explain a technical term that might be unfamiliar to some of you: "We supplement these structure representations with coarse grained tokens encoding secondary structure state (SS8) and solvent accessible surface area (SASA)."

Let's break it down. "Structure representations" refer to the way we depict the 3D shape of a protein or other biological molecule. These representations can be quite detailed, but sometimes we need to simplify them for certain analyses.

That's where "coarse grained tokens" come in. These are simplified representations of the structure that still capture important information. In this case, we're using tokens to represent two specific features of the structure: the secondary structure state (SS8) and the solvent accessible surface area (SASA).

The secondary structure state refers to the way the protein chain is folded into different shapes, like alpha helices and beta sheets. SS8 is a specific classification system that assigns each amino acid in the chain to one of eight categories based on its secondary structure.

The solvent accessible surface area, or SASA, tells us how much of the protein's surface is exposed to the surrounding environment. This can be important for understanding how the protein interacts with other molecules.

By using these coarse grained tokens to represent SS8 and SASA, we can simplify the structure representation while still capturing important information. This can be useful for a variety of analyses, such as predicting protein-protein interactions or understanding how mutations affect protein function.

Function is presented to the model in the form of tokenized keyword sets for each position in the sequence.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept related to machine learning and natural language processing. Specifically, we'll be talking about how function is presented to a model in the form of tokenized keyword sets for each position in a sequence.

Now, I know that might sound a bit technical, so let's break it down.

First, let's define what we mean by "function." In this context, we're referring to the task that the machine learning model is trying to accomplish. For example, the function might be to identify whether a given piece of text is positive or negative in sentiment.

Next, let's talk about what it means to present function to a model. Essentially, this means that we need to provide the model with some kind of input that it can use to learn how to perform the task we want it to do.

In the case of natural language processing, one common way to present function to a model is by using tokenized keyword sets. This means that we take the input text and break it down into individual words or phrases, which we then use as the input to the model.

Finally, we need to specify the position of each keyword set in the sequence. This is important because the order of the words in a sentence can often convey important information about the meaning of the text.

So, to summarize, presenting function to a model in the form of tokenized keyword sets for each position in a sequence is a common technique used in natural language processing to help machine learning models learn how to perform tasks like sentiment analysis or language translation.

I hope that helps! If you have any questions or would like to learn more, please feel free to leave a comment below. Thanks for watching!

ESM3 is a bidirectional transformer.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a concept that might be a bit technical, but we'll try to explain it in a way that's easy to understand.

The concept we're discussing is ESM3, which stands for "Energy Storage Module 3". This is a type of transformer that's used in electrical systems to transfer energy between different circuits.

Now, you might be wondering what a transformer is. In simple terms, a transformer is a device that can change the voltage of an electrical current. This is important because different circuits in an electrical system often require different voltages to function properly.

So, what makes ESM3 special? Well, it's a bidirectional transformer, which means it can transfer energy in both directions. This is useful because it allows for more efficient use of energy in electrical systems.

For example, let's say you have a solar panel that's generating electricity. With a bidirectional transformer like ESM3, you can transfer that energy to a battery for storage, and then later transfer it back to the grid when it's needed.

Overall, ESM3 is an important component in modern electrical systems, and its bidirectional capabilities make it a valuable tool for managing energy efficiently.

While extensive research has gone into creating specialized architectures and training objectives for proteins, we find that tokenization paired with a standard masked language modeling objective and the basic transformer architecture is highly effective for both representation learning and generative modeling.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a recent development in the field of protein research.

Proteins are incredibly complex molecules that play a crucial role in many biological processes. Understanding how they work and how they can be manipulated is a key area of research in fields like medicine and biotechnology.

One approach to studying proteins is to use specialized architectures and training objectives. This involves creating custom models and algorithms that are specifically designed to work with protein data.

However, recent research has shown that a more general approach can also be highly effective. By using a technique called tokenization, which involves breaking down protein sequences into smaller units, and pairing it with a standard masked language modeling objective and the basic transformer architecture, researchers have been able to achieve impressive results in both representation learning and generative modeling.

In other words, by using a more general approach, researchers have been able to achieve similar or even better results than with specialized architectures and training objectives.

This is an exciting development because it means that researchers can potentially save time and resources by using more general techniques, while still achieving high-quality results.

So, that's a brief overview of this recent development in protein research. We hope you found this video helpful and informative!

Sequence, structure, and function tracks are input as tokens, which are embedded and fused, then processed through a
------------------------------
 Sure, here's a script you can use:

Hello everyone, and welcome to this video where we'll be discussing a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but is actually quite simple once you break it down.

The concept we'll be discussing is the use of sequence, structure, and function tracks as input tokens, which are then embedded and fused together before being processed through a neural network.

Now, let's break down what each of these terms means.

Sequence tracks refer to the order in which certain elements appear in a dataset. For example, if we're looking at a dataset of DNA sequences, the sequence tracks would refer to the order in which the nucleotides (A, T, C, and G) appear.

Structure tracks refer to the way in which these elements are organized. In the case of DNA sequences, this might refer to the way in which the nucleotides are paired together to form double helices.

Function tracks refer to the role that these elements play in a larger system. In the case of DNA sequences, this might refer to the way in which certain genes are expressed and how they contribute to the overall functioning of an organism.

So, when we input these tracks as tokens, we're essentially breaking down the dataset into smaller, more manageable pieces that can be analyzed more easily.

Once these tokens are embedded and fused together, they're then processed through a neural network, which is a type of machine learning algorithm that's designed to recognize patterns in data.

By using this approach, we can gain a better understanding of the underlying structure and function of complex datasets, which can be incredibly useful in fields like genetics, biology, and medicine.

So, that's a brief overview of the concept we've been discussing today. I hope you found it helpful, and if you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them in the comments section below. Thanks for watching!###

Figure 1. ESM3 is a generative language model that reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a reference that might seem a bit complicated at first, but don't worry, I'm here to help you understand it.

The reference is about a generative language model called ESM3. Now, what does that mean exactly? Well, let's break it down.

First, a generative language model is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content based on patterns it has learned from existing data. In this case, ESM3 is specifically designed to work with proteins.

Proteins are complex molecules that play many important roles in our bodies, such as building and repairing tissues, transporting molecules, and catalyzing chemical reactions. They are made up of long chains of amino acids, which fold into specific shapes that determine their function.

ESM3 is able to reason over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins. This means that it can analyze the order of amino acids in a protein chain, predict how that chain will fold into a 3D structure, and even make educated guesses about what that protein might do in the body.

So why is this useful? Well, understanding the structure and function of proteins is crucial for many areas of research, such as drug discovery, disease diagnosis, and biotechnology. By using a generative language model like ESM3, scientists can more quickly and accurately predict the properties of proteins, which could lead to faster and more effective treatments for a wide range of diseases.

I hope this explanation has helped you understand the reference to ESM3 and its potential applications in protein research. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them below. Thanks for watching!###

(A) Iterative sampling with ESM3. Sequence, structure, and function can all be used to prompt the model. At each timestep $\mathrm{t}$, a fraction of the masked positions are sampled until all positions are unmasked.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept called iterative sampling with ESM3. Now, I know that sounds like a mouthful, but don't worry, I'm here to break it down for you.

First, let's start with what ESM3 stands for. It's short for "evolutionary scale modeling with 3D structures." Essentially, it's a computer program that helps scientists predict the structure and function of proteins.

Now, let's talk about iterative sampling. This is a technique used by ESM3 to predict the structure of a protein. It works by starting with a sequence of amino acids, which is the building block of proteins. Then, the program uses this sequence to predict the structure of the protein.

But here's where it gets interesting. The program doesn't just rely on the sequence to make its predictions. It also takes into account the function of the protein and the structure of similar proteins. This is what's meant by "sequence, structure, and function can all be used to prompt the model."

So, how does iterative sampling work? Well, at each time step, the program samples a fraction of the masked positions in the protein sequence. These masked positions are areas where the program doesn't have enough information to make a prediction. By sampling these positions, the program can gather more information and refine its predictions.

This process continues until all positions in the protein sequence are unmasked, meaning the program has enough information to make a prediction for the entire protein.

So, there you have it! Iterative sampling with ESM3 is a powerful tool that scientists use to predict the structure and function of proteins. I hope this explanation has been helpful, and thanks for watching!###
==============================
(B) ESM3 architecture. Sequence, structure, and function are represented as tracks of discrete tokens at the input and output. The model is a series of transformer blocks, where all tracks are fused within a single latent space; geometric attention in the first block allows conditioning on atomic coordinates. ESM3 is supervised to predict masked tokens.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the ESM3 architecture. This is a complex topic, but we will do our best to explain it in a way that is easy to understand.

The ESM3 architecture is a model that is used to predict masked tokens. It is made up of a series of transformer blocks, which are used to fuse all tracks within a single latent space. This means that the model is able to take into account both sequence and structure information, as well as function.

At the input and output, the model represents sequence, structure, and function as tracks of discrete tokens. This allows the model to process information in a more efficient and effective way.

One of the key features of the ESM3 architecture is the use of geometric attention in the first block. This allows the model to condition on atomic coordinates, which is important for accurately predicting masked tokens.

Overall, the ESM3 architecture is a powerful tool for predicting masked tokens and is widely used in the field of natural language processing. We hope this explanation has been helpful and thank you for watching!

(C) Structure tokenization. Local atomic structure around each amino acid is encoded into tokens.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept called "Structure tokenization."

Structure tokenization is a process used in the field of bioinformatics to analyze the local atomic structure around each amino acid in a protein. Essentially, it involves breaking down the structure of a protein into smaller, more manageable parts, or "tokens."

Each token represents a specific local structure around an amino acid, such as a helix or a sheet. By analyzing these tokens, researchers can gain a better understanding of how the protein is structured and how it functions.

This information can be incredibly valuable for a variety of applications, such as drug discovery and disease research. By understanding the structure of a protein, scientists can develop targeted therapies that are more effective and have fewer side effects.

So, that's a brief overview of structure tokenization! We hope you found this explanation helpful. If you have any questions or would like to learn more, please feel free to leave a comment below. Thanks for watching!

(D) Models are trained at three scales: 1.4B, 7B, and 98B parameters. Negative log likelihood on test set as a function of training FLOPs shows response to conditioning on each of the input tracks, improving with increasing FLOPs.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a reference that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, we'll break it down for you.

The reference is about training models at different scales, specifically 1.4B, 7B, and 98B parameters. Now, what does that mean? Well, in simple terms, it's about how much data the model is trained on. The more data, the more parameters, and the more complex the model.

But why is this important? Well, the researchers wanted to see how the model performed on a test set, which is a set of data that the model hasn't seen before. They measured the performance using negative log likelihood, which is a way of measuring how well the model predicts the data.

So, what did they find? They found that the model performed better when it was conditioned on each of the input tracks, which means that it was given more information about the data it was trying to predict. And, as they increased the amount of training data, or the number of parameters, the model continued to improve.

So, in summary, this reference is about how training models on different scales can improve their performance, and how conditioning on input tracks can help even more. We hope this explanation was helpful, and if you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments below!

(E) Unconditional generations from ESM3 98B (colored by sequence identity to the nearest sequence in the training set), embedded by ESM3, and projected by UMAP alongside randomly sampled sequences from UniProt (in gray). Generations are diverse, high quality, and cover the distribution of natural sequences.
stack of transformer blocks.

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a reference that might seem a bit complicated at first, but don't worry, I'm here to help you understand it.

The reference is: (E) Unconditional generations from ESM3 98B (colored by sequence identity to the nearest sequence in the training set), embedded by ESM3, and projected by UMAP alongside randomly sampled sequences from UniProt (in gray). Generations are diverse, high quality, and cover the distribution of natural sequences.

Let's break it down step by step.

First, we have "Unconditional generations from ESM3 98B". This means that we're generating sequences of amino acids without any specific conditions or constraints. ESM3 is a type of machine learning model that can predict the structure of proteins, and 98B refers to a specific version of this model.

Next, we have "colored by sequence identity to the nearest sequence in the training set". This means that we're comparing the generated sequences to the sequences in the training set, and coloring them based on how similar they are.

Then, we have "embedded by ESM3". This means that we're using the ESM3 model to create a 3D representation of the generated sequences.

Finally, we have "projected by UMAP alongside randomly sampled sequences from UniProt (in gray)". UMAP is a type of dimensionality reduction technique that allows us to visualize the 3D representations of the sequences in a 2D space. The gray sequences are randomly sampled from UniProt, which is a database of protein sequences.

So, what does all of this mean? Essentially, we're using machine learning models to generate sequences of amino acids that are similar to natural sequences, and then visualizing them in a way that allows us to see their diversity and quality.

I hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them below. Thanks for watching!###

The first transformer block also includes a geometric attention layer for atomic structure coordinate conditioning.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, I'm here to help you understand it.

The concept we're going to be discussing is called "The first transformer block also includes a geometric attention layer for atomic structure coordinate conditioning."

Now, let's break this down into simpler terms.

First, let's talk about what a transformer block is. A transformer block is a type of neural network architecture that is used in natural language processing. It's called a transformer because it's able to transform one type of data into another.

Now, let's talk about the geometric attention layer. This is a type of layer that is used in the transformer block to help it understand the structure of the data it's working with. It does this by paying attention to the relationships between different parts of the data.

Finally, let's talk about atomic structure coordinate conditioning. This is a technique that is used to help the transformer block understand the structure of molecules. It does this by looking at the coordinates of the atoms in the molecule and using that information to help it understand the structure of the molecule.

So, when we put all of these concepts together, what we get is a transformer block that is able to understand the structure of molecules by paying attention to the relationships between different parts of the data and using the coordinates of the atoms in the molecule to help it understand the structure.

I hope this explanation has helped you understand this concept better. If you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments below. Thanks for watching!
==============================
At the output of the model, shallow MLP heads project the final layer representation into token probabilities for each of the tracks.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept related to machine learning models. Specifically, we'll be talking about how the final layer representation is projected into token probabilities for each of the tracks at the output of the model.

Now, I know that might sound a bit confusing, so let's break it down. When we're working with machine learning models, we often use something called a "shallow MLP head." This is a type of neural network that helps us make predictions based on the data we've inputted into the model.

At the end of this process, we're left with a final layer representation. This is essentially a summary of all the information that the model has learned from the data we've given it. However, this representation isn't very useful on its own. We need to be able to turn it into something that we can actually use.

That's where the token probabilities come in. Essentially, we use the final layer representation to predict the probability of each possible outcome. In this case, we're talking about tracks, so we're predicting the probability of each track being the correct one.

So, to summarize: the shallow MLP head projects the final layer representation into token probabilities for each of the tracks at the output of the model. This allows us to make predictions based on the data we've inputted into the model.

I hope that helps! If you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments below. Thanks for watching!

The largest ESM3 model is trained on 2.78 billion natural proteins derived from sequence and structure databases (2, 34-37).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about the ESM3 model and how it was trained on a massive dataset of natural proteins.

The ESM3 model is a type of machine learning model that is used to predict the structure of proteins. It was developed by a team of researchers who wanted to create a more accurate and efficient way to predict protein structures.

To train the ESM3 model, the researchers used a dataset of 2.78 billion natural proteins. These proteins were derived from sequence and structure databases, which are large collections of protein data that have been compiled over many years.

The use of such a large dataset is important because it allows the model to learn from a wide variety of protein structures and sequences. This helps to improve the accuracy of the model's predictions and makes it more useful for researchers who are studying proteins.

So, in summary, the ESM3 model was trained on a massive dataset of natural proteins, which helps to make it a powerful tool for predicting protein structures. Thanks for watching!
==============================
As a small fraction of structures have been experimentally determined relative to sequences, we leverage predicted structures $(4,5)$.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, we'll break it down for you.

So, let's start with the basics. When we talk about structures, we're referring to the three-dimensional shape of a protein or a molecule. These structures are incredibly important because they determine how the protein or molecule will function in our body.

Now, the problem is that while we have a lot of information about the sequences of proteins and molecules, we don't have as much information about their structures. In fact, only a small fraction of structures have been experimentally determined.

This is where the concept of predicted structures comes in. Essentially, we use computer algorithms to predict the structures of proteins and molecules based on their sequences. These predictions are not always 100% accurate, but they can give us a good idea of what the structure might look like.

So, when we say that we leverage predicted structures, we mean that we use these predictions to gain insights into the function of proteins and molecules, even if we don't have experimental data for their structures.

In summary, predicted structures are a powerful tool that allows us to study the function of proteins and molecules, even if we don't have all the information we need. We hope this explanation has been helpful!
==============================
We also generate synthetic sequences with an inverse folding model (described in Appendix A.2.1.3) for all structures, including predicted ones.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that might be a bit technical, but we'll do our best to explain it in a way that's easy to understand.

The concept we're talking about is called "inverse folding." This is a technique used in the field of molecular biology to predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins.

Now, you might be wondering why this is important. Well, proteins are the building blocks of life, and their structure is crucial to their function. By understanding the structure of a protein, we can better understand how it works and how it might be involved in diseases.

So, how does inverse folding work? Essentially, it involves taking a known protein structure and using it as a template to predict the structure of a similar, but unknown protein. This is done using a computer algorithm that takes into account the amino acid sequence of the protein, as well as other factors like the protein's environment and interactions with other molecules.

In the context of the statement we mentioned earlier - "We also generate synthetic sequences with an inverse folding model for all structures, including predicted ones" - this means that the researchers are using inverse folding to predict the structure of proteins that haven't been fully characterized yet. They're then generating synthetic sequences - essentially, computer-generated versions of the protein - to test their predictions and refine their models.

So, that's a brief overview of inverse folding and how it's used in molecular biology research. We hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them in the comments section below. Thanks for watching!###

Function keywords are derived by predicting functional annotations from sequence using a library of hidden markov models (38).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a concept that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, I'm here to help you understand it.

The concept we're going to discuss is called "Function keywords derived by predicting functional annotations from sequence using a library of hidden markov models (38)."

Now, let's break that down into simpler terms.

First, let's talk about "functional annotations." These are descriptions of what a particular gene or protein does in the body. For example, one gene might be involved in regulating blood sugar levels, while another might be involved in fighting off infections.

Next, we have "hidden markov models." These are statistical models that are used to analyze sequences of data, such as DNA or protein sequences. They are called "hidden" because the underlying structure of the data is not directly observed, but rather inferred from the observed data.

Finally, we have "function keywords." These are words or phrases that are used to describe the functional annotations of genes or proteins. For example, a gene involved in regulating blood sugar levels might be associated with keywords like "glucose metabolism" or "insulin signaling."

So, when we put all of these terms together, what we're talking about is a method for predicting the functional annotations of genes or proteins based on their DNA or protein sequences. This method uses hidden markov models to analyze the sequences and generate function keywords that describe what the gene or protein does in the body.

I hope that helps! If you have any questions or would like more information, please feel free to leave a comment below. Thanks for watching!

Overall this increased training data to 3.15 billion protein sequences, 236 million protein structures, and 539 million proteins with function annotations, totaling 771 billion unique tokens.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a recent development in the field of bioinformatics. Specifically, we're going to discuss the increase in training data for protein sequences, structures, and function annotations.

So, what does this mean exactly? Well, let's break it down. First, the increase in protein sequences means that researchers now have access to a larger dataset of amino acid sequences, which are the building blocks of proteins. This is important because it allows scientists to better understand the diversity of proteins and their functions.

Next, the increase in protein structures means that researchers now have access to a larger dataset of 3D structures of proteins. This is important because it allows scientists to better understand how proteins fold and interact with other molecules.

Finally, the increase in function annotations means that researchers now have access to a larger dataset of information about what proteins do in the body. This is important because it allows scientists to better understand the roles that proteins play in various biological processes.

All of this data adds up to a total of 771 billion unique tokens, which is a massive amount of information. This increase in training data will allow researchers to develop more accurate and comprehensive models of protein structure and function, which will ultimately lead to a better understanding of how proteins work in the body.

So, that's a brief overview of the recent increase in training data for protein sequences, structures, and function annotations. We hope you found this video helpful! If you have any questions or comments, please leave them in the comments section below. Thanks for watching!

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a reference that you may have come across in your research or studies. The reference is "Full details of the training dataset are described in Appendix A.2.1.8."

Now, this may seem like a complicated reference, but don't worry, we're here to break it down for you. Essentially, this reference is pointing you to a specific section of a document or report where you can find more information about the training dataset.

The training dataset is a collection of data that is used to train a machine learning model. This dataset is crucial in ensuring that the model is accurate and effective in its predictions.

So, when you see this reference, it's important to take note of it and refer to the specific section in the document where the details of the training dataset are described. This will give you a better understanding of how the machine learning model was trained and the data that was used to do so.

We hope this explanation has been helpful for you. If you have any further questions or need more clarification, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for watching!

We train ESM3 models at three scales: 1.4 billion, 7 billion, and 98 billion parameters.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a reference that might seem a bit technical at first, but don't worry, we'll break it down for you.

The reference is about training ESM3 models at three different scales: 1.4 billion, 7 billion, and 98 billion parameters.

First, let's define what an ESM3 model is. ESM3 stands for "Evolutionary Scale Modeling 3", which is a type of machine learning model used for predicting protein structures. These models are trained on large datasets of protein sequences and structures, and can be used to predict the structure of new proteins.

Now, let's talk about the different scales mentioned in the reference. The number of parameters in a machine learning model refers to the number of adjustable values that the model uses to make predictions. In the case of ESM3 models, the number of parameters can vary depending on the size of the dataset used to train the model.

The three scales mentioned in the reference - 1.4 billion, 7 billion, and 98 billion parameters - refer to the size of the datasets used to train the ESM3 models. A larger dataset will result in a larger number of parameters in the model, which can lead to more accurate predictions.

So, in summary, the reference is about training ESM3 models at different scales, which refers to the size of the datasets used to train the models. This can impact the number of parameters in the model and ultimately affect the accuracy of the predictions.

In an initial series of experiments to evaluate representation learning performance in response to architecture hyperparameters, we find a greater response to increasing depth than to width.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to our video! Today, we're going to be discussing a recent study on representation learning performance and how it responds to different architecture hyperparameters.

In this study, the researchers conducted a series of experiments to evaluate how representation learning performance changes in response to different architecture hyperparameters. Specifically, they looked at the effects of increasing depth and width.

What they found was that increasing depth had a greater impact on representation learning performance than increasing width. This means that adding more layers to a neural network can lead to better performance than simply adding more neurons to each layer.

So, why is this important? Well, it helps us better understand how to design and optimize neural networks for various tasks. By knowing that increasing depth has a greater impact on performance, we can focus on building deeper networks rather than wider ones.

Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the world of neural networks and representation learning. We hope you found this explanation helpful! If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them below. Thanks for watching!

This informed the choice of relatively deep networks for the final architectures, with the 98 billion parameter model incorporating 216 Transformer blocks (Appendix A.1.5).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a technical term that might be unfamiliar to some of you: Transformer blocks.

In the context of the reference we're looking at, the choice of relatively deep networks for the final architectures was informed by the use of Transformer blocks. Specifically, the 98 billion parameter model incorporated 216 Transformer blocks.

So, what are Transformer blocks? Well, they're a type of neural network architecture that was first introduced in a paper by Google in 2017. They're designed to be particularly effective at processing sequential data, such as text or speech.

The basic idea behind Transformer blocks is to use self-attention mechanisms to allow the model to focus on different parts of the input data at different times. This can help the model to better understand the relationships between different parts of the data, and to make more accurate predictions as a result.

In the context of the reference we're looking at, the use of Transformer blocks likely helped to improve the performance of the final model by allowing it to better understand the relationships between different parts of the input data.

So, there you have it! Transformer blocks are a type of neural network architecture that are particularly effective at processing sequential data, and they were used in the final architectures of the model we're discussing today. Thanks for watching!

Scaling ESM3 from 1.4 billion to 98 billion parameters results in substantial improvements in the validation loss for all tracks, with the greatest improvements observed in sequence loss (Fig.1D, Fig.S11).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a recent study that looked at the effects of scaling up a machine learning model called ESM3.

In this study, the researchers scaled up ESM3 from 1.4 billion to 98 billion parameters. What does this mean? Well, parameters are essentially the building blocks of a machine learning model. The more parameters a model has, the more complex it can be and the better it can perform certain tasks.

So, by scaling up ESM3, the researchers were essentially making it more complex and powerful. And what did they find? They found that this scaling resulted in substantial improvements in the validation loss for all tracks.

Validation loss is a measure of how well a model is performing on a set of data that it hasn't seen before. So, the fact that the researchers saw improvements in validation loss means that the scaled-up ESM3 was better at predicting outcomes on new data.

The greatest improvements were observed in sequence loss, which is a specific type of validation loss that measures how well a model can predict the order of events in a sequence. This is important for tasks like predicting the order of amino acids in a protein, which is something that ESM3 is often used for.

Overall, this study shows that scaling up machine learning models like ESM3 can lead to significant improvements in performance. And that's it for today's video! Thanks for watching, and we'll see you next time.

These gains in validation loss lead to better representation learning (Table S7 and Fig.S8).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that might be a bit technical, but we'll do our best to explain it in a way that's easy to understand.

The concept we're talking about is called "validation loss" and it's a term used in machine learning. Essentially, validation loss is a measure of how well a machine learning model is able to predict new data that it hasn't seen before.

Now, you might be wondering why this is important. Well, the answer is that when a machine learning model is able to accurately predict new data, it means that it has learned to recognize patterns in the data that it was trained on. This is called "representation learning" and it's a key part of how machine learning works.

So, when we talk about "gains in validation loss," what we're really talking about is improvements in the model's ability to predict new data. And when we say that these gains lead to better representation learning, we mean that the model is getting better at recognizing patterns in the data.

In single sequence structure prediction (Table S8) on CAMEO, ESM3 98B obtains 0.895 mean local distance difference test (LDDT) and surpasses ESMFold (0.865 LDDT).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a reference related to single sequence structure prediction on CAMEO.

First, let's define some terms. Single sequence structure prediction refers to the process of predicting the 3D structure of a protein based solely on its amino acid sequence. CAMEO is a database that contains information on protein structures and their corresponding amino acid sequences.

Now, let's talk about the reference itself. In Table S8, we see that ESM3 98B obtains a mean local distance difference test (LDDT) of 0.895. LDDT is a measure of how well a predicted protein structure matches the actual structure. A higher LDDT score indicates a better match.

The reference also mentions that ESM3 98B surpasses ESMFold, which has an LDDT score of 0.865. This means that ESM3 98B is better at predicting protein structures than ESMFold.

So, in summary, this reference shows that ESM3 98B is a highly accurate method for predicting protein structures based on amino acid sequences.

Unconditional generation produces high-quality proteins-with a mean predicted LDDT (pLDDT) 0.84 and predicted template modeling score (pTM) 0.52-that are diverse in both sequence (mean pairwise sequence identity 0.155 ) and structure (mean pairwise TM score 0.48 ), spanning the distribution of known proteins (Fig.1E, Fig.S13).

------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a recent breakthrough in the field of protein generation.

In the past, generating high-quality proteins has been a difficult task. However, a new method called "unconditional generation" has been developed that produces proteins with a mean predicted LDDT (pLDDT) of 0.84 and a predicted template modeling score (pTM) of 0.52.

What does this mean? Well, the pLDDT score measures the accuracy of the predicted protein structure, while the pTM score measures how well the predicted structure matches known protein structures.

So, the fact that these scores are high means that the proteins generated using this method are of high quality and are likely to be useful in a variety of applications.

But that's not all! The proteins generated using this method are also diverse in both sequence and structure. This means that they are different from each other and cover a wide range of known protein structures.

In fact, the proteins generated using this method span the distribution of known proteins, as shown in Figure 1E and Figure S13.

Overall, this breakthrough in protein generation is exciting news for the scientific community and has the potential to lead to new discoveries and advancements in a variety of fields.
