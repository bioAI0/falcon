 Certainly! The question at hand is whether the ESM3 model, which has been pre-trained on a large amount of protein sequence data, is capable of generating functional proteins without the need for further fine-tuning or training. In other words, can the model accurately predict the structure and function of proteins based solely on its pre-existing knowledge?

To test this, the researchers likely used a variety of techniques to evaluate the performance of the ESM3 model in generating functional proteins. This might have included comparing the predicted structures and functions of generated proteins to those of known, experimentally validated proteins, as well as assessing the ability of the generated proteins to perform specific biological functions in vitro or in vivo.

Overall, the goal of this research is to determine whether pre-trained models like ESM3 can be used as a starting point for generating novel proteins with specific functions, potentially accelerating the drug discovery process and enabling the development of new therapeutics.

 Certainly! The goal of this project was to develop a new type of green fluorescent protein (GFP) that would have a different amino acid sequence compared to the existing ones. This was done in order to expand the range of available GFPs and potentially improve their performance in certain applications. The team aimed to create a functional GFP with low sequence similarity to the existing ones, which would allow for greater diversity in the available GFPs.

 Fluorescence is a phenomenon where a molecule absorbs light at a specific wavelength and then emits light at a longer wavelength. This process is difficult to achieve because it requires a specific molecular structure and energy levels that allow for the absorption and emission of light. However, once achieved, it is easy to measure because the emitted light can be detected and quantified using specialized equipment.

Fluorescence is also considered one of the most beautiful mechanisms in nature because it produces vibrant and colorful displays in various organisms, such as fluorescent proteins in jellyfish and corals. Additionally, fluorescence has numerous practical applications in fields such as biology, chemistry, and materials science, making it a valuable tool for researchers and experts.

 The fluorescence of jellyfish and the vivid colors of coral are due to proteins in the GFP family. These proteins have the unique ability to form a fluorescent chromophore without requiring any cofactors or substrates. This means that they can emit light on their own, without needing any additional molecules to help them do so. This property has made GFP proteins very useful in a variety of scientific applications, such as tracking the movement of cells or molecules within living organisms.

 The GFP sequence is a gene that codes for a protein called green fluorescent protein. This protein emits a bright green light when it is exposed to certain wavelengths of light. By inserting the GFP sequence into the genome of other organisms, scientists can use this protein to label molecules, cellular structures, or processes within the organism. This allows them to track and visualize these structures or processes under a microscope, providing valuable information about the function and behavior of the organism. The use of GFP has become a foundational toolkit in the biosciences, as it has been applied in a wide range of research areas, including genetics, cell biology, and neuroscience.###

 The GFP family, which stands for Green Fluorescent Protein, has been extensively studied and modified through protein engineering techniques for many years. However, despite these efforts, most of the functional variants of GFP have been discovered by exploring the natural world. This means that scientists have found new and useful versions of GFP by studying organisms that naturally produce them, rather than creating them through laboratory manipulation.

 Rational design and machine learning-assisted high-throughput screening are techniques used to improve the properties of GFP (green fluorescent protein) sequences. These techniques involve making small changes to the amino acid sequence of GFP, typically between 5 to 15 mutations out of the total 238 amino acid coding sequence. The changes are made in a rational manner, based on an understanding of the structure and function of GFP, and are designed to improve specific properties such as brightness or stability. Machine learning algorithms are then used to screen large numbers of GFP variants to identify those with the desired properties. This approach has yielded GFP sequences with improved properties, such as higher brightness or stability, or differently colored variants.

 The statement "Studies have shown that only a few random mutations reduces fluorescence to zero (44-46)" means that according to research, just a small number of random changes in the genetic code can completely eliminate the ability of a protein to fluoresce. The numbers 44-46 refer to specific studies that have demonstrated this phenomenon. This information may be relevant to experts in fields such as genetics, biochemistry, or molecular biology who are interested in understanding the effects of mutations on protein function.

 In most cases, introducing a large number of mutations into a protein sequence can significantly alter its structure and function, potentially leading to a loss of activity or stability. However, in rare instances, scientists have been able to use high throughput experimentation techniques to introduce up to 40-50 mutations, which represents a 20% difference in total sequence identity, while still retaining the protein's GFP fluorescence. This suggests that certain proteins may be more tolerant to mutations than others, and that careful experimentation and analysis can help identify these more robust proteins.

 To generate a new GFP, one would need to understand and replicate the complex biochemistry and physics that are responsible for its fluorescence. This would involve a deep understanding of the molecular structure of GFP, as well as the chemical reactions and physical processes that occur within the protein to produce fluorescence.

One would need to identify the specific amino acid residues within GFP that are responsible for its fluorescence, as well as the chemical bonds and interactions that allow these residues to emit light. Additionally, one would need to understand the role of external factors such as pH, temperature, and light exposure in regulating GFP fluorescence.

Once this understanding is achieved, one could potentially manipulate the amino acid sequence of GFP to create a new variant with different fluorescence properties. This could involve introducing new amino acid residues or modifying existing ones to alter the chemical and physical properties of the protein.

Overall, generating a new GFP would require a deep understanding of the complex biochemistry and physics that underlie its fluorescence, as well as the ability to manipulate these factors to create a new variant with desired properties.###

 Certainly! In green fluorescent proteins (GFPs), the chromophore is formed through an autocatalytic process that involves three key amino acids located in the core of the protein. These amino acids are Ser65, Tyr66, and Gly67. The autocatalytic process begins with the oxidation of Ser65, which then undergoes a cyclization reaction to form a five-membered ring structure. This reaction is followed by the dehydration of Tyr66, which results in the formation of a double bond between the carbon and nitrogen atoms of the amino acid. Finally, the double bond isomerizes to form the chromophore, which is a planar structure consisting of an imidazolidinone ring. This chromophore is responsible for the fluorescence of GFPs, and its formation is essential for the protein's function.

 GFP, or green fluorescent protein, is a protein that exhibits bright green fluorescence when exposed to light in the blue to ultraviolet range. Its unique structure consists of a kinked central alpha helix surrounded by an eleven stranded beta barrel.

The alpha helix runs through the center of the protein and is responsible for the chromophore formation, which is the part of the protein that absorbs and emits light. The kink in the alpha helix is caused by a proline residue, which allows the chromophore to form a planar structure that is necessary for fluorescence.

The beta barrel surrounds the alpha helix and provides a protective environment for the chromophore. It is made up of eleven beta strands that are arranged in an antiparallel fashion, meaning that the direction of the strands alternates. This structure helps to stabilize the protein and protect the chromophore from damage.

Overall, the unique structure of GFP allows it to exhibit bright green fluorescence and makes it a valuable tool in biological research and imaging.###

 Certainly! The process of generating a new fluorescent protein involves several steps, which can be broken down into a chain of thought.

1. Identify the need for a new fluorescent protein: This could be due to limitations of existing fluorescent proteins, such as brightness, stability, or color range.

2. Determine the desired properties of the new fluorescent protein: Based on the specific application, decide on the optimal characteristics for the new protein, such as excitation and emission wavelengths, brightness, stability, and photostability.

3. Choose a suitable protein scaffold: Select a known fluorescent protein with similar properties to the desired protein as a starting point for engineering.

4. Design mutations: Using knowledge of the structure and function of fluorescent proteins, design mutations that are likely to improve the desired properties of the protein.

5. Create mutant library: Generate a large number of mutant proteins by introducing the designed mutations into the chosen protein scaffold.

6. Screen mutant library: Use high-throughput screening techniques to identify mutants with improved properties, such as increased brightness or stability.

7. Characterize promising mutants: Further analyze the selected mutants to confirm their improved properties and ensure they are suitable for the intended application.

8. Optimize the protein: If necessary, make additional mutations to further improve the protein's performance.

9. Validate the protein: Test the new fluorescent protein in various experimental conditions to ensure it performs as expected and is suitable for the intended application.

10. Publish and share the new protein: Once the new fluorescent protein has been validated, publish the results and make the protein available to other researchers for use in their own experiments.

 The ESM3 is a computational tool that assists in the design of new fluorescent proteins. It is prompted with a sequence and structure of residues required for forming and catalyzing the chromophore reaction, as well as the structure of part of the central alpha helix from a natural fluorescent protein. The ESM3 then generates design candidates through a chain of thought. This process involves analyzing the input data and using it to create new protein structures that are predicted to have the desired fluorescent properties. The resulting design candidates can then be further optimized and tested in the laboratory to determine their effectiveness as fluorescent proteins.

 In the first experiment, the team expressed designs with a range of sequence identities and found a notable design with low sequence identity to known fluorescent proteins in well B8. This design appeared to be a bright GFP that was distant from other known GFPs. In the second experiment, the team continued their investigation and found a bright design in well C10, which they designated as esmGFP. The esmGFP was found to be a bright GFP that was also distant from other known GFPs. The team measured fluorescence in E. coli lysate and used positive controls of known GFPs and negative controls with no GFP sequence or no E. Coli to confirm their findings.
User:

 The statement "esmGFP exhibits fluorescence intensity similar to common GFPs" means that the fluorescence intensity of esmGFP is comparable to that of other commonly used green fluorescent proteins (GFPs). This suggests that esmGFP can be used as an alternative to other GFPs in experiments that require fluorescence detection.

The "normalized fluorescence" refers to the process of adjusting the fluorescence intensity of each protein in the experiment to a common scale, allowing for easier comparison between different proteins. In this case, the normalized fluorescence is shown for a subset of proteins in experiment 2, which likely involved the use of esmGFP as a fluorescent tag to monitor protein expression or localization.

Overall, the statement and accompanying information suggest that esmGFP is a useful tool for fluorescence-based experiments and can be used interchangeably with other GFPs.

 Certainly! Excitation and emission spectra are graphical representations of the wavelengths of light that a fluorescent protein, such as esmGFP or EGFP, can absorb and emit, respectively.

When a fluorescent protein is excited with light of a specific wavelength, it absorbs that energy and then emits light at a longer wavelength. The excitation spectrum shows the range of wavelengths that can effectively excite the protein, while the emission spectrum shows the range of wavelengths that the protein emits when it returns to its ground state.

In the case of esmGFP and EGFP, their excitation and emission spectra are very similar, but not identical. Both proteins have a peak excitation wavelength around 488 nm and a peak emission wavelength around 507 nm. However, esmGFP has a slightly broader excitation spectrum and a slightly red-shifted emission spectrum compared to EGFP.

This means that esmGFP can be excited with a wider range of wavelengths and emits light at slightly longer wavelengths than EGFP. This can be advantageous in certain experimental settings where different excitation wavelengths are needed or where there is a need to separate the emission signal from background fluorescence.

I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

 E: The two cutout views of the predicted structure of esmGFP are focused on the central alpha helix and the inside of the beta barrel. The 96 mutations that esmGFP has in comparison to its nearest neighbor, tagRFP, are highlighted in blue. These mutations are likely responsible for the differences in the structures and properties of the two proteins.

 The cumulative density of sequence identity between fluorescent proteins across taxa refers to the level of similarity between different types of fluorescent proteins found in various organisms. In this case, esmGFP has a level of similarity to other fluorescent proteins that is commonly observed when comparing sequences across different orders within the same class. This suggests that esmGFP is a unique type of fluorescent protein with distinct characteristics that set it apart from other known fluorescent proteins.

 Evolutionary distance by time in millions of years (MY) refers to the amount of time that has passed since two species diverged from a common ancestor. This is typically measured by comparing the differences in their DNA or protein sequences. The more differences there are, the longer the time since they diverged.

Sequence identities, on the other hand, refer to the percentage of amino acids that are the same between two protein sequences. For example, if two proteins have 100 amino acids and 80 of them are the same, their sequence identity would be 80%.

In the case of the three example anthozoa GFPs and esmGFP, the evolutionary distance by time in millions of years would depend on when their common ancestor existed. By comparing the differences in their DNA or protein sequences, one could estimate how long ago they diverged from this common ancestor.

The sequence identities between these GFPs and esmGFP would also depend on how many amino acids are the same between them. This can be calculated by aligning their protein sequences and counting the number of identical amino acids.

Overall, these measures can provide insight into the evolutionary relationships and functional similarities between different GFPs.

 Estimating evolutionary distance by time (MY) from GFP sequence identity involves comparing the amino acid sequences of GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) from different species. The more similar the sequences are, the more closely related the species are assumed to be, and the more recently they diverged from a common ancestor.

One common method for estimating evolutionary distance from sequence identity is the Jukes-Cantor model, which assumes that nucleotide substitutions occur at a constant rate over time. This model can be used to calculate the number of nucleotide substitutions per site (dS) between two sequences, which can then be converted into an estimate of the time since divergence (t) using a molecular clock.

To estimate the time since divergence in millions of years (MY), the following formula can be used:

t = dS / (2 x r)

where dS is the number of nucleotide substitutions per site, and r is the rate of nucleotide substitution per site per year.

It is important to note that the accuracy of these estimates depends on several factors, including the quality of the sequence data, the choice of molecular clock, and the assumption of constant evolutionary rates over time. Therefore, it is important to use caution when interpreting these estimates and to consider other lines of evidence when inferring evolutionary relationships and divergence times.

 The statement "We estimate esmGFP is over 500 million years of natural evolution removed from the closest known protein" suggests that esmGFP is a highly evolved protein that has undergone significant changes over a long period of time. This means that it may have unique properties and functions that are not found in other proteins.

The phrase "inward facing coordinating residues" refers to specific amino acid residues within the protein that are positioned in a way that allows them to interact with each other and facilitate a chemical reaction. This suggests that esmGFP has a specific structure that enables it to perform a particular function.

Overall, the statement implies that esmGFP is a highly specialized and unique protein that has evolved over a long period of time to perform a specific function. Its structure and properties may be of interest to researchers studying protein evolution and function.
User:

 Certainly! Once a chromophore has absorbed light, it can undergo a process called fluorescence, where it emits light at a longer wavelength than the absorbed light. This happens because the absorbed energy causes the chromophore to become excited and move to a higher energy state. As the chromophore returns to its ground state, it releases the excess energy in the form of light, which is what we observe as fluorescence. In order for a chromophore to be fluorescent, it must be able to efficiently absorb and emit light, and it must also have a long enough lifetime in its excited state to allow for fluorescence to occur.

 Light emission is the process by which an object emits light. This process is highly dependent on the local electronic environment of the chromophore, which is a molecule or a part of a molecule that is responsible for the color of the object. The electronic environment of the chromophore can greatly affect the energy levels of the electrons in the molecule, which in turn affects the wavelength and intensity of the emitted light. Therefore, any changes in the local electronic environment of the chromophore can have a significant impact on the light emission properties of the object.###

 To obtain a new functional GFP, it is necessary to ensure that the active site and the surrounding long range tertiary interactions throughout the beta barrel are precisely configured. This is because GFP is a complex protein that requires specific structural features to function properly. Any changes to the protein's structure can potentially disrupt its function. Therefore, careful attention must be paid to the configuration of the active site and the surrounding long range tertiary interactions to ensure that the new GFP variant retains its functionality.###

 The process of generating new GFP sequences involves using a pre-trained model called ESM3, which has 7 billion parameters. The model is prompted to generate a protein sequence that is 229 residues long, and the sequence is conditioned on the positions of critical residues that are involved in forming and catalyzing the chromophore reaction. These critical residues are Thr62, Thr65, Tyr66, Gly67, Arg96, and Glu222. By using this approach, it is possible to generate new GFP sequences that may have improved properties or functions.
User:

 I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I do not have access to the specific context or information regarding the experimental structure in 1QY3. Can you please provide more details or context so I can better understand and assist you?
User:

 The input for the expert includes sequence tokens, structure tokens, and atomic coordinates of the backbone. These are used to generate a nearly completely masked array of tokens corresponding to 229 residues, except for the token positions used for conditioning. This means that the input data is used to create a partially hidden set of data that can be used to train a model or perform other analysis. The sequence tokens represent the amino acid sequence of a protein, while the structure tokens represent the three-dimensional structure of the protein. The atomic coordinates of the backbone provide information about the position of the protein's backbone atoms. By combining these different types of data, the expert can gain a more complete understanding of the protein's structure and function.

 Certainly! The chain-of-thought procedure is a problem-solving technique that involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts. In the context of design, this means starting with a general idea or concept and then gradually refining and developing it through a series of steps.

The first step in the chain-of-thought procedure is to identify the problem or challenge that needs to be addressed. This might involve conducting research, gathering data, or consulting with stakeholders to gain a better understanding of the requirements and constraints of the project.

Once the problem has been defined, the next step is to generate a range of potential solutions or design concepts. This might involve brainstorming, sketching, or using other ideation techniques to explore different possibilities.

From there, the design concepts are refined and developed further, with each iteration building on the previous one. This might involve creating prototypes, testing different variations, or seeking feedback from users or other stakeholders.

Throughout the process, the chain-of-thought procedure emphasizes the importance of staying focused on the problem at hand, while also remaining open to new ideas and possibilities. By breaking down the design process into smaller, more manageable steps, it becomes easier to generate innovative and effective solutions that meet the needs of users and stakeholders.

 The model first generates structure tokens, which are essentially the building blocks of a protein's backbone. These structure tokens are used to create a protein backbone, which is the primary structure of a protein. The backbone is formed by the sequence of amino acids that make up the protein, and it determines the overall shape and function of the protein. By generating structure tokens, the model is able to create a protein backbone that is structurally sound and biologically relevant. This is an important step in protein modeling and design, as it allows researchers to study the properties and functions of proteins in a more accurate and efficient manner.

 I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I do not have the context or information about the specific "1QY3 backbone" and the "next step of the chain" that you are referring to. Can you please provide more details or context so that I can better understand your question and provide a helpful response?

 Sure, I'd be happy to explain!

When we add the generated structure to the original prompt, we are essentially creating a new prompt that includes the previously generated content. This new prompt is then used to generate the next sequence in the text.

For example, let's say the original prompt is "The cat sat on the mat." The first sequence generated might be "The cat sat on the mat and purred." We would then add this generated sequence to the original prompt, creating a new prompt that looks like this: "The cat sat on the mat and purred. The cat sat on the mat."

This new prompt is then used to generate the next sequence in the text, which might be "The cat sat on the mat and purred, enjoying the warmth of the sun." We would then add this new sequence to the prompt again, creating a new prompt that looks like this: "The cat sat on the mat and purred. The cat sat on the mat and purred, enjoying the warmth of the sun."

This process continues, with each new sequence being added to the prompt and used to generate the next sequence in the text. By doing this, we are able to create a coherent and structured text that builds upon itself as it is generated.

 I can explain the concept of iterative joint optimization. 

iterative joint optimization is a process of refining and improving a sequence and structure by alternating between optimizing each of them. this process involves multiple iterations, where each iteration involves optimizing one aspect of the sequence or structure, followed by optimizing the other aspect.

for example, in the context of protein structure prediction, iterative joint optimization may involve alternating between optimizing the sequence of amino acids and the 3d structure of the protein. in each iteration, the sequence may be optimized to better fit the desired structure, and then the structure may be optimized to better fit the optimized sequence.

this iterative process allows for a more comprehensive and accurate optimization of both the sequence and structure, as each iteration builds upon the improvements made in the previous iteration. it is a powerful tool for improving the accuracy and efficiency of complex optimization problems.

 I'm sorry, I cannot provide an explanation without further context or information about the specific topic being discussed. Can you please provide more details or clarify the question?

 During the iterative joint optimization stage of the generation protocol, a computational pool of 10 seconds of thousands of candidate GFP designs is drawn from the intermediate and final points. This means that the system generates a large number of potential GFP designs within a short period of time, specifically 10 seconds. These designs are then evaluated and optimized further to create the final GFP design. The computational pool is used to explore a wide range of design possibilities and improve the efficiency of the optimization process.
User:

 Certainly! In this process, we first group the designs based on how similar they are to known fluorescent proteins. This is done by comparing the sequences of the designs to those of the known proteins.

Once the designs are grouped, we apply various filters and ranking criteria to them. These criteria may include factors such as predicted brightness, stability, and folding efficiency. The goal is to identify the most promising designs for further study and development.

The specific details of the filtering and ranking process can be found in Appendix A.5.1.5 of the relevant documentation.

 The process of generating proteins involves synthesizing them and expressing them in E. coli. This is followed by measuring their fluorescence activity at an excitation wavelength of $485 \mathrm{~nm}$. The results of this measurement are shown in Fig. 4B left.
User:

 The statement suggests that the brightness of a certain design was measured and compared to positive controls that have a higher sequence identity with naturally occurring GFPs. This means that the design being tested is likely a variant of GFP, and the researchers wanted to see how its brightness compares to other known GFP variants. The positive controls were likely chosen because they are well-characterized and have been shown to have high brightness levels. By comparing the brightness of the design to these positive controls, the researchers can determine if the design is a promising candidate for further study or if it needs further optimization.

 The highlighted design in well B8 has a sequence identity of only 36% to the 1QY3 sequence and 57% to the nearest existing fluorescent protein, tagRFP. This suggests that the design in well B8 is a novel fluorescent protein with a unique sequence that is not closely related to the 1QY3 sequence or tagRFP.
User:

 The design being referred to is a new type of fluorescent protein that is 50 times less bright than natural GFPs (green fluorescent proteins). Additionally, the chromophore (the part of the protein responsible for fluorescence) takes a week to mature, which is much longer than the typical maturation time of under a day for natural GFPs. Despite these differences, this new design is significant because it demonstrates a signal of function in a previously unexplored area of sequence space. This means that it has the potential to be used in new and innovative ways that have not been possible with natural or engineered GFPs.

 Certainly! The iterative joint optimization and ranking procedure involves a series of steps to improve the brightness of a protein. 

First, we start with the sequence of the protein in well B8, which has already been optimized for brightness. We then use computational modeling to predict how changes in the protein sequence will affect its brightness. 

Next, we generate a set of candidate sequences that are predicted to have improved brightness. We then rank these sequences based on their predicted brightness and select the top candidates for further optimization.

We then use experimental techniques to test the brightness of the top candidates and use the results to refine our computational models. This process is repeated iteratively until we have identified a protein sequence with significantly improved brightness.

Overall, this approach combines computational modeling and experimental validation to efficiently optimize protein brightness, and can be applied to a wide range of proteins for various applications.

 We have generated a second 96 well plate of designs and utilized the same plate reader assay to identify several designs that exhibit a brightness level comparable to that of GFPs found in nature.

 The best design, located in well C10 of the second plate (Fig. 4B right), is designated as esmGFP. This design is considered the best because it exhibits the highest level of fluorescence intensity compared to the other designs on the plate. The esmGFP design is a variant of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) that has been optimized for expression in mammalian cells. It is commonly used as a reporter gene in various biological studies, including gene expression analysis and protein localization studies. The esmGFP design is particularly useful because it is highly stable and can be easily detected using fluorescence microscopy.
User:

 EsmGFP is a variant of green fluorescent protein (GFP) that has been engineered to exhibit brightness similar to that of natural GFPs. This means that it emits light at a similar intensity to the GFPs found in nature, making it a useful tool for imaging and tracking biological processes. The brightness of EsmGFP is an important characteristic because it allows for better visualization of cells and tissues, which can aid in the study of various biological phenomena. Overall, EsmGFP is a valuable tool for researchers who need to track and observe biological processes in living organisms.###

 The fluorescence intensity of esmGFP, a replicate of B8, a chromophore knockout of B8, along with three natural GFPs avGFP, cgreGFP, ppluGFP were evaluated at 0, 2, and 7 days of chromophore maturation. The results of these measurements were then plotted and presented in Figure 4C.
User:

 The statement suggests that a new variant of GFP, called esmGFP, takes a longer time to reach its full potential compared to other known GFPs. However, after two days, esmGFP achieves a similar level of brightness as the other GFPs. This information may be useful for researchers who are considering using esmGFP in their experiments and need to plan accordingly for the longer maturation time.
User:

 The statement suggests that the researchers conducted an experiment to confirm that the fluorescence observed in their study was caused by the specific amino acid residues Thr65 and Tyr66. To do this, they created variants of the protein B8 and esmGFP by mutating Thr65 and Tyr66 to glycine. The researchers then observed that these mutated variants lost their fluorescence activity, indicating that Thr65 and Tyr66 were indeed responsible for the observed fluorescence. This experiment provides evidence to support the researchers' conclusion that Thr65 and Tyr66 are the key amino acid residues responsible for fluorescence in their study.

 The excitation and emission spectra of esmGFP and EGFP were analyzed and compared. The peak excitation for esmGFP was found to occur at 496 nm, which is shifted by 7 nm compared to the peak excitation of EGFP at 489 nm. However, both proteins emit at a peak of 512 nm. This information is presented in Figure 4D.
User:

 The shapes of the spectra suggest that the excitation spectrum of esmGFP has a narrower full-width half-maximum (FWHM) compared to EGFP, with values of 39mm and 56nm, respectively. On the other hand, the FWHM of their emission spectra are highly comparable, with values of 35nm and 39nm for EGFP and esmGFP, respectively. This indicates that esmGFP has a narrower range of excitation wavelengths that can effectively excite the protein, while its emission spectrum is similar to that of EGFP.
User:

 The statement "Overall, esmGFP exhibits spectral properties consistent with known GFPs" means that the fluorescent protein called esmGFP has similar characteristics to other green fluorescent proteins (GFPs) that have been previously studied. This suggests that esmGFP can be used in similar ways as other GFPs, such as for imaging and tracking biological processes in cells and organisms. The spectral properties refer to the specific wavelengths of light that the protein emits when it is excited, which can be measured and compared to other GFPs. This information is useful for researchers who want to use esmGFP in their experiments and need to know how it compares to other fluorescent proteins.

 Certainly! The sequence and structure of esmGFP were compared to known proteins in order to determine its similarity to other proteins and gain insight into its potential function. This is a common approach in protein analysis and can provide valuable information about the protein's evolutionary history, functional domains, and potential interactions with other proteins. By comparing the sequence and structure of esmGFP to known proteins, researchers can also identify potential homologs or orthologs, which can aid in the study of protein function and evolution.
User:

 The user has performed two different types of searches to identify the nearest neighbor to a protein called B8. The first search was a BLAST search against the non-redundant protein sequences database, which is a commonly used database for protein sequence searches. The second search was an MMseqs search of ESM3's training set, which is a machine learning-based protein sequence search tool. Both searches reported the same top hit, which was a protein called tagRFP. The sequence identity between tagRFP and B8 was found to be 58%, which means that there are 96 mutations throughout the sequence. This information can be useful for understanding the evolutionary relationship between B8 and tagRFP, as well as for predicting the function of B8 based on the known function of tagRFP.
User:

 The statement is describing the relationship between two different types of fluorescent proteins, esmGFP and eqFP578. EsmGFP is a variant that has been designed, meaning it has been intentionally modified from its natural form. The closest wildtype sequence to esmGFP is eqFP578, which is a red fluorescent protein. The two proteins differ in 107 sequence positions, which means they have a 53% identity. This information is important for understanding the properties and potential uses of these fluorescent proteins in research and other applications.

 The esmGFP and tagRFP proteins have sequence differences that are spread throughout their structures, as shown in Figure 4E. These differences include 22 mutations that occur within the protein's interior, which is known to be highly sensitive to mutations due to the close proximity of the chromophore and the high density of interactions. This information is important for experts in the field of protein structure and function, as it highlights the potential impact of these mutations on the proteins' properties and behavior.
User:

 The statement suggests that the level of similarity between esmGFP and other fluorescent proteins is comparable to the level of similarity found when comparing sequences across taxonomic orders within the same taxonomic class. This means that esmGFP is not closely related to other fluorescent proteins, but it still shares some similarities with them. The examination of the sequence alignment of 648 natural and designed GFP-like fluorescent proteins was conducted to determine the level of similarity between esmGFP and other fluorescent proteins.
User:

 The difference between esmGFP and other FPs is comparable to the level of difference observed between FPs belonging to the orders of scleractinia (stony corals) and actiniaria (sea anemones), which are both part of the larger class anthozoa of marine invertebrates. This is illustrated in Figure 4G.
User:

 The esmGFP protein has the closest sequence identity to FPs from the anthozoa class, specifically corals and anemones, with an average sequence identity of 51.4%. However, it also shares some sequence identity with FPs from the hydrozoa class, which includes jellyfish, with an average sequence identity of 33.4%. This information is presented in Figure S22.

 Evolutionary biology can provide insights into the amount of time it would take for a protein with similar sequence identity to arise through natural evolution. This is because the rate of evolution can be estimated by comparing the sequences of proteins from different species and calculating the number of amino acid substitutions that have occurred over a certain period of time.

By using this approach, scientists can estimate the time it would take for a protein with a certain level of sequence identity to evolve naturally. For example, if two proteins have a sequence identity of 80%, it may take millions of years for them to evolve to that level of similarity through natural selection and genetic mutations.

However, it is important to note that the rate of evolution can vary depending on various factors such as the size of the population, the selective pressure, and the mutation rate. Therefore, the estimated time for a protein to evolve to a certain level of sequence identity is just an approximation and may not be accurate for all cases.
User:

 In Fig. 4G, we are presenting a comparison of esmGFP with three different types of GFPs that are found in Anthozoan organisms. The purpose of this comparison is to highlight the similarities and differences between these different types of GFPs and to provide insight into their potential uses in various applications.

 The statement suggests that a time-calibrated phylogenetic analysis of the Anthozoans was conducted recently, which estimated the time in millions of years ago (MYA) to the last common ancestor of each pair of species. This information can be used to estimate the evolutionary time between each pair of species.

 The researchers used a dataset of six Anthozoan GFPs and species with known MYA (million years ago) to last common ancestors and GFP sequence identities. They then constructed a simple estimator that correlates sequence identity between FPs (fluorescent proteins) to MY of evolutionary time between the species. This allowed them to calibrate against natural evolution. The results are shown in Figure 4H.

 The statement suggests that the protein esmGFP has undergone a significant amount of evolution, estimated to be equivalent to over 500 million years, compared to the closest protein found in nature. This implies that esmGFP has undergone numerous mutations and adaptations over time, resulting in a highly evolved and specialized protein. The analysis likely involved comparing the genetic sequence of esmGFP to other known proteins and estimating the number of changes that have occurred over time. This information could be useful for understanding the function and potential applications of esmGFP in various fields, such as biotechnology and medicine.
