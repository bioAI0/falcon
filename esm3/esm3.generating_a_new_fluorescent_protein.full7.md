==============================
We sought to understand if the base pre-trained ESM3 model has sufficient biological fidelity to generate functional proteins. We set out to create a functional green fluorescent protein (GFP) with low sequence similarity to existing ones. We chose the functionality of fluorescence because it is difficult to achieve, easy to measure, and one of the most beautiful mechanisms in nature.
------------------------------
 We wanted to know if a pre-trained model called ESM3 could create proteins that work properly. To test this, we tried to make a special type of protein called GFP that glows green. We wanted to make sure it was different from other GFPs that already exist. We chose to make it glow because it's hard to do, easy to see, and really cool!

Explanation:
ESM3 is a pre-trained model that we used to generate proteins. GFP stands for green fluorescent protein, which is a type of protein that glows green. We wanted to create a new version of GFP that was different from existing ones. Fluorescence is the ability of a substance to emit light, and it's a difficult property to achieve in proteins. We chose to make our GFP glow green because it's a beautiful and easily measurable example of fluorescence in nature.

Responsible for the fluorescence of jellyfish and the vivid colors of coral (43), proteins in the GFP family are unique in their ability to form a fluorescent chromophore without cofactors or substrates (27). This property allows the GFP sequence to be inserted into the genomes of other organisms to visibly label molecules, cellular structures, or processes, providing a foundational toolkit that has been broadly applied across the biosciences.

The GFP family of proteins is responsible for the fluorescence of jellyfish and the vivid colors of coral. These proteins have a unique ability to form a fluorescent chromophore without the need for cofactors or substrates. This property allows scientists to insert the GFP sequence into the genomes of other organisms to visibly label molecules, cellular structures, or processes. This has become a foundational toolkit that is widely used in the biosciences.

==============================
The GFP family has been the subject of decades of protein engineering efforts, but still the vast majority of functional variants have come from prospecting the natural world. Rational design and machine learning-assisted highthroughput screening have yielded GFP sequences with improved properties-such as higher brightness or stability, or differently colored variants-that incorporated small numbers of mutations (typically 5 to 15 , out of the total 238 amino acid coding sequence) from the originating sequence. Studies have shown that only a few random mutations reduces fluorescence to zero (44-46). whereas in rare cases, leveraging high throughput experimentation, scientists have been able to introduce up to $40-50$ mutations i.e. a $20 \%$ difference in total sequence identity $(44,47,48)$ while retaining GFP fluorescence.
------------------------------
 The GFP family has been extensively studied and modified through protein engineering, but most functional variants have been found in nature. Scientists have used rational design and machine learning to create GFP sequences with improved properties, such as higher brightness or stability, by making small changes to the original sequence. However, studies have shown that too many random mutations can reduce fluorescence to zero, and introducing too many mutations can also be difficult. Despite this, scientists have been able to introduce up to 40-50 mutations while retaining GFP fluorescence through high throughput experimentation.

In this paragraph, GFP stands for Green Fluorescent Protein, which is a protein that emits green light when exposed to certain wavelengths of light. Protein engineering is the process of modifying proteins to improve their properties or create new functions. Rational design is a method of protein engineering that involves making specific changes to a protein's sequence based on known structural and functional information. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that can analyze large amounts of data to identify patterns and make predictions. High throughput experimentation involves testing many different variants of a protein in a short amount of time to identify the best performing ones.

 [[GFP]] is a protein that fluoresces, and it is commonly used in biological research as a marker. The process of creating a new GFP involves the materialization of complex biochemistry and physics that underlie its fluorescence. In all GFPs, an autocatalytic process forms the chromophore from three key amino acids in the core of the protein. The unique structure of GFP, a kinked central alpha helix surrounded by an eleven stranded beta barrel, is what allows it to fluoresce.

(A) We prompt ESM3 with the sequence and structure of residues required for forming and catalyzing the chromophore reaction, as well as the structure of part of the central alpha helix from a natural fluorescent protein (left). Through a chain of thought, ESM3 generates design candidates (right). (B) ESM3 found a bright GFP distant from other known GFPs in two experiments. We measured fluorescence in E. coli lysate. Top row, photograph of plates. Bottom row, plate reader fluorescence quantification. Positive controls of known GFPs are marked with purple circles, negative controls with no GFP sequence or no E. Coli are marked with red circles. In the first experiment (left) we expressed designs with a range of sequence identities. A notable design with low sequence identity to known fluorescent proteins appears in the well labeled B8 (highlighted in a black circle bottom, white circle top). We continue the chain of thought from the protein in B8 for the second experiment (right). A bright design appears in the well labeled C10 (black circle bottom, white circle top) which we designate esmGFP. (C) esmGFP exhibits fluorescence intensity similar to common GFPs. Normalized fluorescence is shown for a subset of proteins in experiment 2. (D) Excitation and emission spectra for esmGFP overlaid on the spectra of EGFP.

with inward facing coordinating residues, enables this reaction (49). Once formed, the chromophore must not just absorb light but also emit it in order to be fluorescent. Light emission is highly sensitive to the local electronic environment of the chromophore. For these reasons, obtaining a new functional GFP would require precise configuration of both the active site and the surrounding long range tertiary interactions throughout the beta barrel.

Explanation:
In this paragraph, the authors describe their process of using ESM3 to generate a new fluorescent protein called esmGFP. They explain that they prompted ESM3 with the sequence and structure of residues required for forming and catalyzing the chromophore reaction, as well as the structure of part of the central alpha helix from a natural fluorescent protein. Through a chain of thought, ESM3 generated design candidates, and they found a bright GFP distant from other known GFPs in two experiments. They measured fluorescence in E. coli lysate and found that esmGFP exhibits fluorescence intensity similar to common GFPs. They also explain that esmGFP has the level of similarity to all other FPs that is typically found when comparing sequences across orders, but within the same class. Finally, they estimate that esmGFP is over 500 million years of natural evolution removed from the closest known protein.

In an effort to generate new GFP sequences, we directly prompt the base pretrained 7B parameter ESM3 to generate a 229 residue protein conditioned on the positions Thr62, Thr65, Tyr66, Gly67, Arg96, Glu222, which are critical residues for forming and catalyzing the chromophore reaction (Fig. 4A). We additionally condition on the structure of residues 58 through 71 from the experimental structure in 1QY3, which are known to be structurally important for the energetic favorability of chromophore formation (50). Specifically, sequence tokens, structure tokens, and atomic coordinates of the backbone are provided at the input and generation begins from a nearly completely masked array of tokens corresponding to 229 residues, except for the token positions used for conditioning.

In this paragraph, the authors are discussing their efforts to create new GFP sequences. They are using a technique called "direct prompting" to generate a 229 residue protein using a pretrained model called ESM3. They are conditioning the generation on critical residues for forming and catalyzing the chromophore reaction, as well as the structure of residues known to be important for the energetic favorability of chromophore formation. The authors are providing sequence tokens, structure tokens, and atomic coordinates of the backbone as input, and generating from a nearly completely masked array of tokens corresponding to 229 residues.

We generate designs using a chain-of-thought procedure as follows. The model first generates structure tokens, effectively creating a protein backbone. Backbones that have sufficiently good atomic coordination of the active site but differentiated overall structure from the 1QY3 backbone pass through a filter to the next step of the chain. We add the generated structure to the original prompt to generate a sequence conditioned on the new prompt. We then perform an iterative joint optimization, alternating between optimizing the sequence and the structure. We reject chainsof-thought that lose atomic coordination of the active site (Appendix A.5.1). We draw a computational pool of $10 \mathrm{~s}$ of thousands of candidate GFP designs from the intermediate and final points in the iterative joint optimization stage of the generation protocol. We then bucket the designs by sequence similarity to known fluorescent proteins and filter and rank designs using a variety of metrics (details in Appendix A.5.1.5)

We performed a first experiment with 88 designs on a 96 well plate, with the top generations in each sequence similarity bucket. Each generated protein was synthesized, expressed in E. coli, and measured for fluorescence activity at an excitation wavelength of $485 \mathrm{~nm}$ Fig. 4B left. We measured brightness similar to positive controls from a number of designs that have higher sequence identity with naturally occurring GFPs. We also identify a design in well B8 (highlighted in a black circle) with only $36 \%$ sequence identity to the 1QY3 sequence and $57 \%$ sequence identity to the nearest existing fluorescent protein, tagRFP. This design was 50x less bright than natural GFPs and its chromophore matured over the course of a week, instead of in under a day, but it presents a signal of function in a new portion of sequence space that to our knowledge has not been found in nature or through protein engineering.

 We conducted an experiment with 88 different designs on a 96 well plate, focusing on the top generations in each sequence similarity bucket. Each design was synthesized, expressed in E. coli, and measured for fluorescence activity at an excitation wavelength of $485 \mathrm{~nm}$. The results are shown in Fig. 4B left. We found that some of the designs had higher sequence identity with naturally occurring GFPs and showed similar brightness. However, we also identified a design in well B8 (highlighted in a black circle) that had only $36 \%$ sequence identity to the 1QY3 sequence and $57 \%$ sequence identity to the nearest existing fluorescent protein, tagRFP. This design was 50x less bright than natural GFPs and its chromophore matured over the course of a week, instead of in under a day. Nonetheless, this design presents a signal of function in a new portion of sequence space that has not been found in nature or through protein engineering to our knowledge.

In this experiment, we used [[GFP]] (green fluorescent protein) as a positive control. GFP is a protein that emits green light when exposed to blue or ultraviolet light. We also used [[tagRFP]] (a red fluorescent protein) as a reference for the design in well B8. [[Sequence identity]] refers to the degree of similarity between two protein sequences. [[Sequence similarity bucket]] refers to a group of designs that have a certain level of sequence identity with each other. [[Chromophore]] is a molecule that gives a protein its color. [[Protein engineering]] is the process of designing and creating new proteins with specific functions.
==============================
We continue the chain of thought starting from the sequence of the design in well B8 to generate a protein with improved brightness, using the same iterative joint optimization and ranking procedure as above. We create a second 96 well plate of designs, and using the same plate reader assay we find that several designs in this cohort have a brightness in the range of GFPs found in nature. The best design, located in well C10 of the second plate (Fig. 4B right), we designate esmGFP.

Explanation:
In this paragraph, the researchers are trying to improve the brightness of a protein called GFP (green fluorescent protein) by creating new designs and testing them using a plate reader assay. They start with a sequence of the design in well B8 and use a joint optimization and ranking procedure to generate new designs. They create a second 96 well plate of designs and test them using the same plate reader assay. They find that several designs in this cohort have a brightness in the range of GFPs found in nature. The best design, located in well C10 of the second plate, they call esmGFP.
User:
==============================
We find esmGFP exhibits brightness in the distribution of natural GFPs. We evaluated the fluorescence intensity at 0 , 2 , and 7 days of chromophore maturation, and plot these measurements for esmGFP, a replicate of B8, a chromophore knockout of B8, along with three natural GFPs avGFP, cgreGFP, ppluGFP (Fig. 4C). esmGFP takes longer to mature than the known GFPs that we measured, but achieves a comparable brightness after two days. To validate that fluorescence was mediated by the intended Thr65 and Tyr66, we show that B8 and esmGFP variants where these residues were mutated to glycine lost fluorescence activity (Fig. S21).
------------------------------
 [[esmGFP]] is a type of fluorescent protein that we studied. We found that it takes longer to mature than other known GFPs, but eventually becomes just as bright. We also confirmed that its fluorescence is caused by specific amino acids, Thr65 and Tyr66. [[B8]] is a type of GFP that we used as a comparison in our study. We also created a [[chromophore knockout]] of B8, which lacks the amino acids responsible for fluorescence. [[avGFP]], [[cgreGFP]], and [[ppluGFP]] are other types of GFPs that we compared to esmGFP in our study. [[Fig. 4C]] is a figure that shows our measurements of fluorescence intensity for these different types of GFPs. [[Fig. S21]] is a supplementary figure that shows how mutating specific amino acids in B8 and esmGFP affects their fluorescence activity.

Analysis of the excitation and emission spectra of esmGFP reveals that its peak excitation occurs at $496 \mathrm{~nm}$, which is shifted $7 \mathrm{~nm}$ relative to the $489 \mathrm{~nm}$ peak for EGFP, while both proteins emit at a peak of $512 \mathrm{~nm}$ (Fig. 4D). The shapes of the spectra indicated a narrower full-widthhalf-maximum (FWHM) for the excitation spectrum of esmGFP (39mm for esmGFP vs $56 \mathrm{~nm}$ for EGFP), whereas the FWHM of their emission spectra were highly comparable ( $35 \mathrm{~nm}$ and $39 \mathrm{~nm}$, respectively). Overall esmGFP exhibits spectral properties consistent with known GFPs.
------------------------------
 [[EsmGFP]] is a type of [[GFP]] that has been analyzed in terms of its excitation and emission spectra. The peak excitation for EsmGFP occurs at $496 \mathrm{~nm}$, which is shifted by $7 \mathrm{~nm}$ compared to the peak excitation of [[EGFP]] at $489 \mathrm{~nm}$. However, both EsmGFP and EGFP emit at a peak of $512 \mathrm{~nm}$. The excitation spectrum of EsmGFP has a narrower full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of 39mm compared to EGFP's FWHM of $56 \mathrm{~nm}$. On the other hand, the FWHM of their emission spectra are highly comparable at $35 \mathrm{~nm}$ and $39 \mathrm{~nm}$, respectively. Overall, EsmGFP exhibits spectral properties that are consistent with known GFPs.

==============================
We next sought to understand how the sequence and structure of esmGFP compares to known proteins. A BLAST (51) search against the non-redundant protein sequences database and an MMseqs (52) search of ESM3's training set report the same top hit-tagRFP, which was also the nearest neighbor to B8-with $58 \%$ sequence identity, representing 96 mutations throughout the sequence. tagRFP is a designed variant, and the closest wildtype sequence to esmGFP from the natural world is eqFP578, a red fluorescent protein, which differs from esmGFP by 107 sequence positions ( $53 \%$ identity). Sequence differences between esmGFP and tagRFP occur throughout the structure (Fig. 4E) with 22 mutations occurring in the protein's interior, which is known to be intensely sensitive to mutations due to chromophore proximity and a high density of interactions (46).
------------------------------
 We wanted to understand how esmGFP compares to other known proteins, so we used two different search methods to find similar sequences. The top hit was tagRFP, which is a designed variant of a red fluorescent protein. The closest wildtype sequence to esmGFP is eqFP578, which is also a red fluorescent protein. There are 107 sequence positions that differ between esmGFP and eqFP578, which means they have 53% identity. The differences between esmGFP and tagRFP are spread throughout the protein structure, with 22 mutations occurring in the interior of the protein. This is important because the interior of the protein is very sensitive to mutations due to its proximity to the chromophore and the high density of interactions.

Examination of a sequence alignment of 648 natural and designed GFP-like fluorescent proteins revealed that esmGFP
has the level of similarity to all other FPs that is typically found when comparing sequences across taxonomic orders, but within the same taxonomic class (Fig. 4F). For example, the difference of esmGFP to other FPs is similar to level of difference between FPs belonging to the orders of scleractinia (stony corals) and actiniaria (sea anemones) both of which belong to the larger class anthozoa of marine invertebrates (Fig. 4G). The closest FPs to esmGFP come from the anthozoa class (corals and anemones), average sequence identity $51.4 \%$, but esmGFP also shares some sequence identity with FPs from the hydrozoa (jellyfish) where the famous avGFP was discovered, average sequence identity $33.4 \%$ (Fig. S22).

In simpler terms, esmGFP is a type of fluorescent protein that is similar to other fluorescent proteins found in marine invertebrates like corals and sea anemones. It also shares some similarities with fluorescent proteins found in jellyfish. This information was discovered by examining the differences in the sequences of 648 different fluorescent proteins.

==============================
We can draw insight from evolutionary biology on the amount of time it would take for a protein with similar sequence identity to arise through natural evolution. In Fig. 4G we show esmGFP alongside three Anthozoan GFPs. We use a recent time-calibrated phylogenetic analysis of the Anthozoans (53) that estimated the millions of years ago (MYA) to last common ancestors to estimate evolutionary time between each pair of these species. Using a larger dataset of six Anthozoan GFPs and species for which we have accurate MYA to last common ancestors and GFP sequence identities, we construct a simple estimator that correlates sequence identity between FPs to MY of evolutionary time between the species (Fig. $4 \mathrm{H}$ ) to calibrate against natural evolution. Based on this analysis we estimate esmGFP represents an equivalent of over 500 million years of evolution from the closest protein that has been found in nature.
