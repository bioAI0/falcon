0More than three billion years of evolution have produced an image of biology encoded into the space of natural proteins.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the fascinating concept of how over three billion years of evolution have led to the encoding of biology within the space of natural proteins.

To understand this concept, we must first delve into the world of proteins. Proteins are complex molecules that are essential for the functioning of all living organisms. They are made up of long chains of amino acids, which are the building blocks of life.

Over the course of evolution, these amino acids have been arranged in countless different ways, resulting in the vast array of proteins that we see today. Each protein has a unique structure and function, and it is this diversity that has allowed life to thrive and adapt to changing environments.

What is truly remarkable is that this diversity has been encoded into the very space of natural proteins. In other words, the structure of proteins themselves contains information about the biological processes they are involved in.

This encoding has been shaped by billions of years of evolution, as organisms have adapted and evolved to better survive and reproduce. The result is a complex and intricate web of biological information that is embedded within the very fabric of life.

So, to summarize, over three billion years of evolution have led to the encoding of biology within the space of natural proteins. This encoding has allowed life to thrive and adapt, and it is a testament to the incredible power of evolution to shape the world around us.

We present ESM3, a frontier multimodal generative language model that reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing ESM3, a cutting-edge multimodal generative language model that has the ability to reason over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins.

ESM3 stands for Evolutionary Scale Modeling 3, and it is a deep learning model that has been trained on a massive dataset of protein sequences and structures. This model is capable of generating new protein sequences and predicting their structures and functions with a high degree of accuracy.

What makes ESM3 unique is its ability to reason over multiple modalities, including sequence, structure, and function. This means that it can take into account the relationships between these different aspects of proteins and use that information to make more accurate predictions.

One of the key applications of ESM3 is in the field of drug discovery. By using this model to generate new protein sequences and predict their structures and functions, researchers can identify potential drug targets and design new drugs that are more effective and have fewer side effects.

Overall, ESM3 represents a major breakthrough in the field of protein modeling and has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach drug discovery and other areas of protein research.

ESM3 can follow complex prompts combining its modalities and is highly responsive to biological alignment.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing the reference to ESM3 and its capabilities.

ESM3 stands for "Expert System Model 3" and it is a highly advanced system that is capable of following complex prompts and combining its modalities. This means that it can take in multiple inputs and use them to make decisions or perform tasks.

But what really sets ESM3 apart is its responsiveness to biological alignment. This means that it is able to adapt and respond to changes in the biological environment, making it highly effective in a variety of applications.

For example, in the medical field, ESM3 could be used to analyze patient data and provide personalized treatment plans based on their unique biological makeup. In agriculture, it could be used to optimize crop yields by analyzing soil and weather data.

Overall, ESM3 is a powerful tool that has the potential to revolutionize many industries. Its ability to follow complex prompts and respond to biological alignment makes it a valuable asset for experts in a variety of fields.

We have prompted ESM3 to generate fluorescent proteins with a chain of thought.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a fascinating topic that has been making waves in the scientific community: the use of ESM3 to generate fluorescent proteins.

Now, for those of you who may not be familiar with ESM3, it stands for "Evolutionary Structural Modeling 3." This is a powerful computational tool that allows researchers to predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins based on their amino acid sequences.

So, how does this relate to fluorescent proteins? Well, fluorescent proteins are a type of protein that emit light when they are exposed to certain wavelengths of light. They are incredibly useful in a variety of scientific applications, such as imaging cells and tissues, tracking the movement of molecules, and even detecting the presence of certain diseases.

However, the process of creating new fluorescent proteins can be time-consuming and expensive. That's where ESM3 comes in. By using this tool, researchers can generate new fluorescent proteins by predicting their three-dimensional structures and then modifying their amino acid sequences to enhance their fluorescent properties.

In other words, ESM3 allows scientists to "prompt" the creation of new fluorescent proteins by guiding the evolution of their structures and properties. This is a truly groundbreaking development that has the potential to revolutionize the field of protein engineering.

So, there you have it! We hope this video has helped to explain the exciting new developments in the world of fluorescent proteins and ESM3. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them in the comments section below. Thanks for watching!

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a fascinating discovery in the field of fluorescent proteins.

Our team has been working on synthesizing different generations of fluorescent proteins, and we have made a remarkable find. We have discovered a bright fluorescent protein that is quite different from any known fluorescent proteins. In fact, it only shares 58% identity with known fluorescent proteins.

This is a significant finding because it opens up new possibilities for research and applications in various fields such as biotechnology, medical imaging, and even environmental monitoring.

We are excited about the potential of this new fluorescent protein and look forward to further exploring its properties and applications.

Similarly distant natural fluorescent proteins are separated by over five hundred million years of evolution.

------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a fascinating topic related to natural fluorescent proteins.

Have you ever wondered how scientists are able to study the inner workings of cells and organisms? One of the tools they use is fluorescent proteins, which are naturally occurring proteins that emit light when exposed to certain wavelengths of light.

Now, you might be thinking, "That's interesting, but what does it have to do with evolution?" Well, it turns out that scientists have discovered that some fluorescent proteins are incredibly similar, despite being found in organisms that are separated by hundreds of millions of years of evolution.

For example, there are fluorescent proteins found in jellyfish and corals that are very similar to those found in some types of fish. And yet, these organisms are separated by over five hundred million years of evolution!

So, what does this mean for our understanding of evolution and the natural world? It suggests that certain traits and characteristics can persist over incredibly long periods of time, even as species diverge and evolve in different directions.

It also highlights the importance of studying diverse organisms and ecosystems, as we never know what fascinating discoveries we might make.
