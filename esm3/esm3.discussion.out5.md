 [[Language models]] can help us explore a wider range of [[proteins]] than what has been discovered through natural evolution. They can generate functional proteins that would take evolution a long time to find. These models don't have to follow the same physical constraints as evolution, but they can still create a model of the many possible paths evolution could have taken.

 [[Proteins]] can be thought of as existing in a specific area where they are surrounded by other proteins that are only one small change away from them. The way that proteins evolve can be visualized as a network within this space, connecting all proteins through the paths that evolution can take between them. These paths represent the ways in which one protein can transform into another without causing harm to the larger system they are a part of.
