 The statement "More than three billion years of evolution have produced an image of biology encoded into the space of natural proteins" means that over the course of three billion years, the process of evolution has resulted in the creation of a vast array of proteins that are essential for biological processes. These proteins are encoded in the genetic material of living organisms and are responsible for a wide range of functions, from catalyzing chemical reactions to providing structural support.

The next sentence, "Here we show that language models trained on tokens generated by evolution can act as evolutionary simulators to generate functional proteins that are far away from known proteins," refers to a recent study in which researchers used computer models to simulate the process of protein evolution. By training these models on data generated by the process of evolution, the researchers were able to generate new proteins that were structurally and functionally distinct from known proteins.

The study used a language model called ESM3, which is a "frontier multimodal generative language model" that can reason over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins. This means that the model is capable of generating new proteins that are not only structurally distinct from known proteins, but also have unique functional properties.

The researchers were able to prompt ESM3 to generate fluorescent proteins, which are proteins that emit light when exposed to certain wavelengths of light. By following a "chain of thought" prompt, the model was able to generate a new fluorescent protein that was structurally distinct from known fluorescent proteins, but still had the ability to emit light.

The significance of this finding is that the new fluorescent protein is structurally distinct from known fluorescent proteins by a distance of 58%, which is a significant amount. This means that the new protein is not simply a minor variation of an existing protein, but rather a completely new protein with unique properties.

The researchers also note that similarly distant natural fluorescent proteins are separated by over five hundred million years of evolution. This suggests that the new protein generated by ESM3 is not simply a random variation, but rather a product of a complex evolutionary process that has been simulated by the language model.

Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of language models and computer simulations to generate new proteins with unique properties that could have important applications in biotechnology and medicine.
