==============================
We have found that language models can reach a design space of proteins that is distant from the space explored by natural evolution, and generate functional proteins that would take evolution hundreds of millions of years to discover. Protein language models do not explicitly work within the physical constraints of evolution, but instead can implicitly construct a model of the multitude of potential paths evolution could have followed.
------------------------------
 [[Language models]] are computer programs that can analyze and generate human language. In this context, they are used to explore the "design space" of proteins, which refers to the vast number of possible protein structures and functions that could exist. [[Evolution]] is the process by which species change over time through natural selection. The design space of proteins explored by evolution is limited by physical constraints, such as the laws of chemistry and physics. However, language models can generate functional proteins that are not limited by these constraints, allowing them to explore a much larger design space. By doing so, they can potentially discover new proteins that would take evolution millions of years to find.

==============================
Proteins can be seen as existing within an organized space where each protein is neighbored by every other that is one mutational event away (54). The structure of evolution appears as a network within this space, connecting all proteins by the paths that evolution can take between them. The paths that evolution can follow are the ones by which each protein transforms into the next without the collective loss of function of the system it is a part of.

In this paragraph, we are discussing the relationship between proteins and evolution. Proteins are the building blocks of life and are essential for the proper functioning of cells and organisms. Evolution is the process by which species change over time, adapting to their environment and developing new traits.

The concept of a "mutational event" refers to a change in the DNA sequence of a gene that can result in a different protein being produced. This can happen due to errors during DNA replication or as a result of exposure to mutagens such as radiation or chemicals.

The "organized space" mentioned in the paragraph refers to the idea that all possible proteins can be arranged in a network, with each protein being connected to its neighbors by a single mutational event. This network represents the potential paths that evolution can take as it explores new protein structures and functions.

The "loss of function" mentioned in the paragraph refers to the idea that changes to a protein can sometimes result in it no longer being able to perform its original function. This can be harmful to the organism, so evolution must find a way to preserve the function of the protein while still allowing it to change and adapt.

Overall, the paragraph is discussing the complex relationship between proteins and evolution, and how the structure of the protein network can influence the paths that evolution can take.

==============================
It is in this space that a language model sees proteins. It sees the data of proteins as filling this space, densely in some regions, and sparsely in others, revealing the parts that are accessible to evolution. Since the next token is generated by evolution, it follows that to solve the training task of predicting the next token, a language model must predict how evolution moves through the space of possible proteins. To do so it will need to learn what determines whether a path is feasible for evolution.
