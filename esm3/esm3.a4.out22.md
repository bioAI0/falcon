 Hello and welcome to this video on YouTube. Today, we will be discussing a topic related to machine learning and natural language processing. Specifically, we will be talking about algorithms that are used to tune large models trained via unsupervised learning to better follow instructions and align their generations to user preferences.

Now, let's break down some of the terms used in this context. First, we have RLHF, which stands for Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback. This is a technique that involves training a model to generate text based on feedback from human users. The feedback can be in the form of ratings or preferences, and the model learns to generate text that is more aligned with the user's preferences.

Next, we have IRPO, which stands for Iterative Reasoning Preference Optimization. This is a specific algorithm that is used to tune large models trained via unsupervised learning. IRPO combines supervised finetuning with contrastive learning from preference pairs.

Now, let's talk about the dataset used in IRPO. The dataset consists of prompt $x$ and a pair of completions $y_{w}$ (preferred) and $y_{l}$ (not preferred). The prompt $x$ is the input given to the model, and the completions $y_{w}$ and $y_{l}$ are the two possible outputs that the model can generate. The preferred completion $y_{w}$ is the one that is more aligned with the user's preferences, while the not preferred completion $y_{l}$ is the one that is less aligned with the user's preferences.

Finally, we have the reference model $\pi_{\text {ref }}$ and the current model $\pi_{\theta}$. The reference model $\pi_{\text {ref }}$ is the fixed base model of the same scale, and the current model $\pi_{\theta}$ is the model being optimized. The reference model is used as a baseline for comparison, while the current model is the one that is being trained to generate text that is more aligned with the user's preferences.

In summary, IRPO is an algorithm used to tune large models trained via unsupervised learning to better follow instructions and align their generations to user preferences. It operates on a dataset consisting of prompt $x$ and a pair of completions $y_{w}$ and $y_{l}$, and uses two separate models: the reference model $\pi_{\text {ref }}$ and the current model $\pi_{\theta}$.

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the reference to experts in the field of machine learning. In particular, we will be looking at the equation (2) which is used to explain the IRPO algorithm.

Let's start by breaking down the equation into its different components. The first term on the right-hand side is the Negative Log Likelihood or NLL. This term measures the difference between the predicted probability distribution and the true probability distribution of the data. The lower the NLL, the better the model fits the data.

The second term on the right-hand side is the DPO or Differential Privacy Objective. This term is used to ensure that the model is privacy-preserving. The alpha parameter controls the trade-off between privacy and accuracy. The higher the alpha, the more privacy is preserved, but the lower the accuracy of the model.

The left-hand side of the equation is the IRPO or Iterative Refinement with Privacy Objective. This is the objective function that we want to minimize in order to find the optimal parameters for our model.

Now let's look at the terms inside the log function. The first term is the log of the predicted probability distribution given the input data. The second term is the log of the ratio of the predicted probability distribution and the reference probability distribution. This term is used to ensure that the model is privacy-preserving.

Finally, the beta parameter controls the trade-off between privacy and accuracy. The higher the beta, the more privacy is preserved, but the lower the accuracy of the model.

In summary, equation (2) is used to explain the IRPO algorithm which is used to train privacy-preserving machine learning models. The equation consists of two terms, the NLL and the DPO, which are used to measure the fit of the model to the data and the privacy of the model, respectively. The IRPO objective function is used to find the optimal parameters for the model. The terms inside the log function are used to ensure that the model is privacy-preserving. The alpha and beta parameters are used to control the trade-off between privacy and accuracy.

 Hello and welcome to this video on the IRPO loss function. In this video, we will be discussing the two terms that make up the IRPO loss function, as well as the two hyperparameters that are used to control the behavior of the loss function.

The IRPO loss function is used in the field of machine learning, specifically in the context of preference-based learning. The goal of preference-based learning is to train a model to generate outputs that are preferred by a human expert, rather than simply minimizing a standard loss function.

The IRPO loss function contains two terms: the $\mathcal{L}_{\text {NLL }}$ term and the $\mathcal{L}_{\text {DPO }}$ term. The $\mathcal{L}_{\text {NLL }}$ term is responsible for maximizing the log likelihood of the preferred example, normalized by the length of the sequence. This term provides a signal to reinforce the good generations from the model.

The $\mathcal{L}_{\text {DPO }}$ term is the contrastive preference tuning term. This term increases the difference in log likelihoods between the preferred and not preferred examples, while staying close to the reference model. The use of the reference model serves as a regularizer to prevent overfitting to the preference dataset, which can often be small.

There are two hyperparameters that are used to control the behavior of the IRPO loss function: $\alpha$ and $\beta$. The $\alpha$ parameter weights the relative importance of the supervised loss with the preference loss. The $\beta$ parameter controls how close we stay to the reference model. The higher the beta, the closer we stay to the reference model.

Finally, we minimize this loss function with respect to the current model parameters $\theta$. This means that we adjust the parameters of the model to minimize the IRPO loss function, which in turn helps us to generate outputs that are preferred by the human expert.

In summary, the IRPO loss function is a powerful tool in the field of preference-based learning. By using the $\mathcal{L}_{\text {NLL }}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{\text {DPO }}$ terms, as well as the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ hyperparameters, we can train a model to generate outputs that are preferred by a human expert.

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of ESM3, a multi-modal model used in the field of bioinformatics.

ESM3 is a model that can take in multiple types of input tracks, such as partial sequences, structures, and functions, and generate output tracks, such as amino-acid sequences. In our experiments, we will be focusing on generating amino-acid sequences.

When generating an amino-acid sequence from a prompt, there are many possible multi-step decoding paths that can be taken. However, computing the full likelihood of generating a sequence from a prompt would require integrating over all possible paths, which is intractable.

To overcome this challenge, we use a surrogate that mirrors pre-training. This surrogate is shown in Equation (3) and involves computing the probability of generating a sequence from a prompt using a pre-trained model.

In summary, ESM3 is a multi-modal model that can generate amino-acid sequences from various input tracks. To compute the likelihood of generating a sequence from a prompt, we use a surrogate that mirrors pre-training.

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference related to the field of Bayesian statistics. In particular, we will be looking at equation 3, which is a common approximation used in Bayesian inference.

Let's start by breaking down the equation. The left-hand side of the equation is the logarithm of the posterior distribution, which is the probability distribution of the parameters given the observed data. The posterior distribution is what we are interested in when doing Bayesian inference.

The right-hand side of the equation is an approximation of the posterior distribution using a set of particles, which are samples from the prior distribution. The expectation is taken over all possible sets of particles, and the sum is taken over all particles in each set.

The logarithm of the likelihood function is used in the approximation, which is the probability of the observed data given the parameters. The likelihood function is multiplied by the prior distribution to obtain the posterior distribution.

The approximation is useful because it allows us to approximate the posterior distribution using a set of particles, which can be computationally more efficient than directly computing the posterior distribution.

In summary, equation 3 is a common approximation used in Bayesian inference to approximate the posterior distribution using a set of particles. It involves taking the logarithm of the likelihood function and the prior distribution, and summing over all possible sets of particles.

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a script that can be used on YouTube to explain a reference to experts. The reference we will be discussing is related to the field of natural language processing and specifically, the task of language modeling.

In this task, we are given a prompt $x$ and a generation $y$ and our goal is to approximate the likelihood of $y$ given $x$. To do this, we use a technique called masked language modeling.

Masked language modeling involves masking out certain words in the input sequence and then predicting those masked words. In this case, we mask out the words in $y$ and then use a language model called ESM3 to predict the masked words.

ESM3 is a state-of-the-art language model that has been trained on a large corpus of text data. It takes as input a sequence of words and outputs a probability distribution over the next word in the sequence.

To compute the likelihood of $y$ given $x$, we first mask out the words in $y$ and then use ESM3 to predict the masked words. We then compute the cross-entropy of the predicted probabilities with the actual words in $y$.

During training, we use the same mask to compute the likelihoods for the reference policy vs current policy, as well as for the preferred sample vs non preferred sample. This helps us to optimize our language model and improve its performance on the task of language modeling.

In summary, to approximate the likelihood of a generation $y$ from prompt $x$, we use masked language modeling with ESM3 and compute the cross-entropy of the predicted probabilities with the actual words in $y$. We also use the same mask during training to compute the likelihoods for the reference policy vs current policy, as well as for the preferred sample vs non preferred sample.

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the reference provided in the link. This reference is a mathematical equation that may not be immediately clear to those who are not experts in the field. So, let's break it down and explain each term in detail.

The equation is:

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_07_04_ec502911ad4bd45c738bg-54.jpg?height=656&width=1718&top_left_y=225&top_left_x=187)

Let's start with the left side of the equation. We have the term "∂Ψ/∂t". This term represents the partial derivative of the wave function, Ψ, with respect to time, t. In simpler terms, it represents how the wave function changes over time.

Moving on to the right side of the equation, we have "iħ(∂²Ψ/∂x²)". This term represents the second partial derivative of the wave function with respect to position, x, multiplied by the imaginary unit, i, and Planck's constant divided by 2π, ħ. This term is commonly referred to as the Schrödinger equation and it describes how the wave function of a quantum mechanical system changes with respect to space and time.

Finally, we have the term "V(x)Ψ". This term represents the potential energy of the system at a given position, x, multiplied by the wave function, Ψ. The potential energy is a measure of the energy that a system possesses due to its position or configuration.

So, in summary, this equation represents how the wave function of a quantum mechanical system changes over time and space, taking into account the potential energy of the system. We hope this explanation has been helpful in understanding this reference. Thank you for watching!###

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of multimodal protein editing with ESM3.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those who are not experts in this field.

ESM3 stands for "energy-based sequence-to-structure mapping." It is a computational tool that is used to predict the three-dimensional structure of a protein based on its amino acid sequence.

In the context of this study, ESM3 is used to expose a buried helix in a protein while maintaining the alternating alpha-beta sandwich fold of the protein. This means that ESM3 is able to modify the structure of a protein in a way that allows for a specific helix to be exposed, while still maintaining the overall shape and function of the protein.

Now, let's move on to the two-step iterative edit that is mentioned in the study.

In the first step, secondary structure prompting and function prompting are used to idealize a reference TIM barrel. A TIM barrel is a type of protein structure that is commonly found in enzymes and other proteins. It consists of a series of alpha-beta sheets that are arranged in a cylindrical shape.

Secondary structure prompting is a technique that is used to predict the secondary structure of a protein based on its amino acid sequence. This information is then used to guide the idealization of the TIM barrel structure.

Function prompting is a technique that is used to predict the function of a protein based on its amino acid sequence. This information is also used to guide the idealization of the TIM barrel structure.

In the second step, secondary structure prompting is used again to increase the number of subunits in the TIM barrel from 8 to 11. This means that the TIM barrel structure is modified to include more subunits, which can potentially increase its stability and function.

Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of ESM3 as a tool for multimodal protein editing, which can be used to modify the structure and function of proteins in a precise and controlled manner.

 In this script, we will be discussing the DPO term of the loss function and how it helps to fine-tune the model for preference pairs.

First, let's define some terms. The DPO term stands for "Differential Preference Ordering" and is a measure of how well the model is able to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred pairs of items. The loss function is a mathematical formula that measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual output of the model.

Now, let's take a closer look at the DPO term of the loss function. It is defined as the negative logarithm of the probability that the model assigns to the correct preference order for a given pair of items. This probability is calculated using the log-likelihood ratio between the model's predicted probabilities and the reference probabilities.

The log-likelihood ratio is a measure of how much more likely the model's predicted probabilities are compared to the reference probabilities. If the log-likelihood ratio is positive, it means that the model is more likely to predict the correct preference order. If it is negative, it means that the model is less likely to predict the correct preference order.

The DPO term of the loss function is then calculated by taking the average of the log-likelihood ratios over all pairs of items in the dataset. This gives us a measure of how well the model is able to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred pairs of items.

In summary, the DPO term of the loss function is a measure of how well the model is able to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred pairs of items. It is calculated using the log-likelihood ratio between the model's predicted probabilities and the reference probabilities, and is a useful tool for fine-tuning the model for preference pairs.

 In this video, we will be discussing the softplus function and its use in approximating the hinge function. The softplus function is defined as $f(z) = -\log \sigma(-\beta z) = \log (1 + \exp (\beta z))$, where $\beta$ is a parameter that controls the steepness of the function.

The softplus function is a smooth approximation of the hinge function, which is defined as $f(z) = \beta z$ when $z >> 0$ and $f(z) = 0$ when $z \ll 0$. This means that the softplus function is a good approximation of the hinge function when $z$ is either very positive or very negative.

There are two cases to consider when using the softplus function. In the first case, where $\log \frac{\pi_{\mathrm{ref}}\left(y_{w} \mid x\right)}{\pi_{\mathrm{ref}}\left(y_{l} \mid x\right)} >> \log \frac{\pi_{\theta}\left(y_{w} \mid x\right)}{\pi_{\theta}\left(y_{l} \mid x\right)}$, the softplus function is in the linear regime. This means that the loss function is simply maximizing the likelihood ratio $\log \frac{\pi_{\theta}\left(y_{w} \mid x\right)}{\pi_{\theta}\left(y_{l} \mid x\right)}$.

In the second case, where $\log \frac{\pi_{\mathrm{ref}}\left(y_{w} \mid x\right)}{\pi_{\mathrm{ref}}\left(y_{l} \mid x\right)} \ll \log \frac{\pi_{\theta}\left(y_{w} \mid x\right)}{\pi_{\theta}\left(y_{l} \mid x\right)}$, the loss has saturated. This means that we do not deviate too far from the reference model.

In summary, the softplus function is a useful approximation of the hinge function, and can be used in various applications such as machine learning and optimization. By understanding the properties of the softplus function, we can better utilize it in our work.

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the dynamics of ESM3 finetuning.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those not specializing in this field. ESM3 stands for Ensemble Square Meter, which is a statistical method used to estimate the uncertainty of a model's predictions. Finetuning refers to the process of adjusting the parameters of a model to improve its accuracy.

Now, let's dive into the dynamics of ESM3 finetuning. When we use a surrogate instead of the true likelihood, we are essentially using an approximation of the true likelihood function. This surrogate function is used to estimate the uncertainty of the model's predictions.

During the finetuning process, we want to adjust the parameters of the model to minimize the loss function. The loss function measures the difference between the predicted values and the true values. We want to minimize this difference to improve the accuracy of the model.

However, we also need to ensure that the model does not deviate too much from the reference model. This is where the dynamics of ESM3 finetuning come into play. As we adjust the parameters of the model, we need to ensure that the loss function is increasing the surrogate of the preferred pair over the non-preferred pair.

The preferred pair refers to the pair of parameters that result in the lowest loss function. The non-preferred pair refers to the pair of parameters that result in a higher loss function. By increasing the surrogate of the preferred pair, we are essentially increasing the likelihood of selecting those parameters during the finetuning process.

However, we also need to ensure that the model does not deviate too much from the reference model. If the current model deviates too much from the reference model, we may need to adjust the parameters to bring it back in line with the reference model.

In summary, the dynamics of ESM3 finetuning involve adjusting the parameters of the model to minimize the loss function while also ensuring that the model does not deviate too much from the reference model. By increasing the surrogate of the preferred pair, we can improve the accuracy of the model while also maintaining its consistency with the reference model.

 Hello and welcome to this video on preference tuning in protein structure prediction. In this video, we will be discussing the most important part of preference tuning, which is deciding how to bucket generations into preferences.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those not specializing in this field. Preference tuning refers to the process of adjusting the parameters of a protein structure prediction algorithm to generate sequences that are more likely to be stable and correct.

When we talk about the quality of a sequence, we are referring to its viability as a stable protein. This means that the sequence is likely to fold into a stable 3D structure that can perform its biological function.

On the other hand, correctness refers to the extent to which the generated sequence follows the given prompt. In this context, we are specifically talking about structure coordinate prompts, which are used to guide the protein structure prediction algorithm towards a specific structure.

To measure prompt consistency, we can use constrained site RMSD (cRMSD), which is the RMSD between the prompt coordinates and the corresponding coordinates in the predicted structure of the generated sequence.

Finally, to measure sequence quality, we can use predicted-TM (pTM) of a structure predictor on the generated sequence. pTM is a measure of how well the predicted structure of the sequence matches the known structure of similar proteins.

So, when we talk about bucketing generations into preferences, we are essentially trying to find the right balance between quality and correctness to generate sequences that are both stable and accurate.

I hope this explanation has been helpful. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them in the comments section below. Thank you for watching!###

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the potential risks of over-optimizing a metric, specifically in the context of structure prediction.

When we talk about structure prediction, we are referring to the process of predicting the three-dimensional structure of a protein based on its amino acid sequence. This is an important task in the field of structural biology, as understanding the structure of a protein can provide valuable insights into its function and potential therapeutic applications.

One common metric used to evaluate the accuracy of structure prediction models is the pTM score, which stands for "predicted TM score." The TM score is a measure of the similarity between two protein structures, with a score of 1 indicating a perfect match and a score of 0 indicating no similarity. The pTM score is a predicted version of the TM score, which is calculated based on the predicted structure of a protein.

While the pTM score can be a useful metric for evaluating the accuracy of structure prediction models, there is a risk of over-optimizing this metric. This means that the model may become too focused on improving the pTM score, even if it means sacrificing other important properties of the predicted structure, such as its stability or biological function.

To mitigate this risk, it is important to use orthogonal models to rank the training dataset and to perform evaluation. Orthogonal models are models that are independent of the pTM score and can provide a more holistic view of the accuracy of the structure prediction model. By using multiple metrics to evaluate the model, we can ensure that we are not sacrificing important properties of the predicted structure in the pursuit of a higher pTM score.

In summary, while the pTM score can be a useful metric for evaluating the accuracy of structure prediction models, it is important to be aware of the potential risks of over-optimizing this metric. By using orthogonal models to rank the training dataset and to perform evaluation, we can ensure that we are not sacrificing important properties of the predicted structure in the pursuit of a higher pTM score. Thank you for watching!###

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the process of creating training datasets for structure prediction. In this field, we use a variety of terms and acronyms that may not be familiar to everyone, so let's start by defining some of the key terms.

First, let's talk about cRMSD, which stands for "root mean square deviation." This is a measure of how closely two structures match each other. The lower the cRMSD value, the more similar the structures are.

Next, we have pTM, which stands for "probability of true match." This is a measure of how likely it is that two structures are truly similar, rather than just appearing similar due to chance.

Now, let's talk about ESM3 7B. This is a specific structure prediction model that we will be using as a reference for our training datasets.

To create our training datasets, we evaluate generations according to cRMSD and pTM of ESM3 7B. This helps us maintain a consistent structure predictor across all datasets.

After the preference tuning phase, we evaluate the generations from the tuned models with ESMFold cRMSD and pTM as an orthogonal model. This means that we are using a different structure prediction model to evaluate the quality of our generations.

Finally, we train on ESM3 derived metrics while evaluating on ESMFold derived metrics. This helps us reduce the risk of over optimization for adversarial generations.

In summary, we use cRMSD and pTM to evaluate the quality of our training datasets, and we use ESM3 7B as a reference model. We also use ESMFold as an orthogonal model for evaluation, and we train on ESM3 derived metrics while evaluating on ESMFold derived metrics to reduce the risk of over optimization.

Thank you for watching, and we hope this explanation has been helpful!###

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the ESM3 model scales and their training process.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those not specializing in this field.

ESM3 stands for Evolutionary Scale Modeling 3, which is a deep learning model used for protein structure prediction.

The IRPO loss is a type of loss function used in the training process of the ESM3 model. It stands for Inter-Residue Pairwise Orientation loss and is used to optimize the model's ability to predict protein structures.

The preconstructed training datasets are sets of data used to train the ESM3 model. They consist of structure coordinate prompts and generations of various difficulty.

The ESM3 model scales refer to different versions of the ESM3 model that have been trained on different datasets.

Now, let's discuss the training process of the ESM3 model scales.

Each ESM3 model scale is trained with the IRPO loss on its respective preconstructed training dataset. These datasets have 16 generations each for 30,000 prompts from the respective ESM3 model.

Preference selection is determined via a threshold of metrics. A sample is considered "good" if it has ESM3 7B pTM $>0.8$ and backbone cRMSD to its structure prompt $<1.5 \AA$.

ESM3 7B pTM stands for the predicted TM-score of the ESM3 model with 7B parameters. The TM-score is a metric used to evaluate the similarity between two protein structures.

Backbone cRMSD stands for the root mean square deviation of the backbone atoms between the predicted protein structure and its structure prompt.

In summary, the ESM3 model scales are trained on preconstructed datasets using the IRPO loss. Preference selection is determined via a threshold of metrics, and a sample is considered "good" if it has a high predicted TM-score and low backbone cRMSD.

Thank you for watching, and we hope this explanation has been helpful.

 Hello and welcome to this video on explaining a reference to experts. In this video, we will be discussing the concept of preference pairs and how they are used in the field of protein engineering.

To begin, let's define what a preference pair is. A preference pair is a set of two protein samples, one of which is considered "good" and the other "bad". These samples are paired together based on their properties, such as their pTM and backbone RMSD.

Now, let's dive into the details of these properties. pTM stands for predicted transmembrane domain, which is a region of a protein that spans the cell membrane. The pTM value is a measure of how likely it is that a given region of a protein will form a transmembrane domain.

Backbone RMSD, on the other hand, is a measure of how much the backbone of a protein deviates from its ideal structure. It is calculated by comparing the coordinates of the backbone atoms in two protein structures.

When creating preference pairs, it is important to ensure that there is a significant difference between the "good" and "bad" samples. This is why a gap is enforced between the pTM and backbone RMSD values of the paired generations. Specifically, the delta pTM must be greater than or equal to 0.2, and the delta backbone RMSD must be less than or equal to -2 Å.

It is also worth noting that each prompt can have multiple preference pairs, and prompts with no valid preference pair are discarded. This ensures that only the most informative and relevant data is used in the protein engineering process.

In summary, preference pairs are a useful tool in protein engineering that involve pairing "good" and "bad" protein samples based on their pTM and backbone RMSD values. By enforcing a gap between these values, experts can ensure that the data used in the protein engineering process is informative and relevant.

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the structure prompts used in our pre-training pipeline.

First, let's define what we mean by "structure prompts". These are essentially a set of proteins that are used to train our machine learning models. They are derived from PDB structures, which are publicly available databases of protein structures.

Now, let's break down the composition of these structure prompts. Half of them are what we call "synthetic active sites". These are essentially artificially created protein structures that are designed to mimic the active sites of real proteins. Active sites are the regions of a protein where chemical reactions occur, so by creating synthetic active sites, we can train our models to better predict the behavior of real proteins.

The other half of the structure prompts are "structure coordinates randomly masked with a noise schedule". This might sound a bit technical, but let me explain. Essentially, we take real protein structures and randomly mask out certain parts of them. This is done to simulate the noise and variability that can occur in real-world protein structures. By training our models on these masked structures, we can improve their ability to handle noisy or incomplete data.

Finally, it's worth noting that all of the structure prompts we use were derived from PDB structures with a temporal cutoff of before May 1st, 2020. This means that we only used structures that were publicly available before that date. This is important because it ensures that our models are not biased towards any recent developments or discoveries in the field of protein structure prediction.

So there you have it - a brief overview of the structure prompts used in our pre-training pipeline. I hope this explanation has been helpful, and if you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask!###

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of synthetic active sites and how they are derived from PDB structures.

First, let's define some key terms. PDB stands for Protein Data Bank, which is a repository of three-dimensional structures of proteins and nucleic acids. Coordinating residues refer to the amino acids that are involved in binding to a ligand or substrate in a protein's active site.

Now, let's talk about synthetic active sites. These are artificial sites that are designed to mimic the function of a natural active site in a protein. They are created by identifying coordinating residues in PDB structures and then using that information to design a new site with similar properties.

To find the coordinating residues in a PDB structure, researchers typically use computational methods such as molecular docking or molecular dynamics simulations. These methods allow them to predict which amino acids are likely to be involved in binding to a particular ligand or substrate.

Once the coordinating residues have been identified, the next step is to design a synthetic active site that can mimic their function. This is typically done using techniques such as rational design or directed evolution. In rational design, researchers use their knowledge of protein structure and function to design a new site that is optimized for a particular function. In directed evolution, researchers use genetic engineering techniques to create a large library of potential active sites, and then screen them for the desired function.

In summary, synthetic active sites are artificial sites that are designed to mimic the function of a natural active site in a protein. They are derived from PDB structures by identifying coordinating residues and then using that information to design a new site with similar properties. This approach has many potential applications in fields such as drug discovery and biotechnology.

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of masking prompts in a cosine noise schedule. This is a technique used in the field of machine learning, specifically in the context of natural language processing.

Let's start by breaking down the terms used in this statement. The first term is "remaining structure track prompts." This refers to the prompts that are left over after some initial processing has been done on a dataset. These prompts are used to generate new text based on the patterns and structures found in the original dataset.

The next term is "cosine noise schedule." This is a type of noise that is added to the prompts in order to make them more diverse and less predictable. Cosine noise is a type of noise that is generated using a mathematical function called the cosine function. This function produces a smooth, oscillating pattern that is used to add noise to the prompts.

Now let's talk about the masking process. In this context, masking refers to the process of hiding or removing certain parts of the prompts. This is done in order to make the prompts more challenging for the machine learning model to predict, which can lead to better performance.

The statement says that $50 \%$ of the noise scheduled prompts are masked in completely random positions. This means that half of the prompts are randomly selected and some parts of them are hidden or removed. The other $50 \%$ of the prompts are masked according to an autocorrelation mechanism that prefers sequentially masked positions. Autocorrelation is a statistical technique that measures the correlation between different parts of a dataset. In this case, it is used to identify patterns in the prompts and mask them in a way that preserves those patterns.

Overall, this technique is used to make the prompts more diverse and challenging for the machine learning model, which can lead to better performance in natural language processing tasks.

I hope this explanation has been helpful. If you have any questions or comments, please leave them in the comments section below. Thank you for watching!###

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference model used in the field of natural language processing. In this specific case, we will be focusing on the ESM3 model and how it is trained.

To begin, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those who are not experts in this field. The ESM3 model is a type of language model that is used to generate text based on a given prompt. It is trained using a dataset that consists of generations of its own reference model. This means that the model is trained using its own previous outputs as input data.

Now, let's move on to the training process itself. For each prompt, we generate samples from the corresponding ESM3 model scale using iterative decoding with $L / 4$ steps. Here, $L$ refers to the length of the prompt. Iterative decoding is a process where we generate text one character at a time, with each character being generated based on the previous characters that have been generated.

During the iterative decoding process, we anneal the temperature from 1.0 to 0.5 over the decoding steps. Annealing refers to the process of gradually reducing the temperature of the system over time. In this case, the temperature refers to the probability distribution used to generate the text. By gradually reducing the temperature, we can ensure that the generated text becomes more and more coherent and relevant to the given prompt.

In summary, the ESM3 model is trained using a dataset that consists of generations of its own reference model. For each prompt, we generate samples from the corresponding ESM3 model scale using iterative decoding with $L / 4$ steps, where $L$ is the length of the prompt. We anneal the temperature from 1.0 to 0.5 over the decoding steps to ensure that the generated text becomes more and more coherent and relevant to the given prompt.

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing atomic coordination tasks and how they relate to the generation of proteins.

Atomic coordination tasks refer to the process of creating proteins that meet specific tertiary interaction constraints. These constraints are challenging because they require the protein to have a specific 3D structure that is not always easy to achieve.

To accomplish this task, the model is given a set of residues that are close together in 3D space but far apart in sequence. This information is used to generate a protein that meets the required constraints.

To evaluate the performance of these tasks, we have curated a dataset of 46 proteins with ligand binding sites from the Biolip dataset. These proteins were all deposited in the PDB after the training set cutoff date of December 1st, 2020.

The coordinating residues that are shown to the model are defined by the ligand binding sites in the Biolip dataset. These sites are listed in Table S13.

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the use of ESM3 in generating novel structures for ligand binding sites.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those not specializing in this field. ESM3 stands for Evolutionary Scale Modeling 3, which is a computational method used to predict protein structures. A ligand binding site is a specific region on a protein where a ligand, or a molecule that binds to the protein, interacts with the protein.

Now, let's dive into the details of how ESM3 is used to generate novel structures for ligand binding sites. ESM3 is prompted with the sequence and coordinates of the residues for a particular ligand binding site. This means that ESM3 is given information about the specific location on the protein where the ligand binds.

Next, ESM3 is asked to generate novel structures by applying multiple transformations to the prompt. This means that ESM3 will make changes to the original sequence and coordinates of the ligand binding site to create new, unique structures.

The total sequence length is sampled evenly to be 150, 250, or 350 residues, regardless of the original sequence length. This means that ESM3 will create new structures with a specific number of residues, regardless of how many residues were in the original sequence.

Next, a contiguous span of coordinating residues is defined to be prompt residues with fewer than 5 sequence positions between them. This means that ESM3 will focus on a specific region of the protein where the ligand binds and make changes to that region.

The order and distance between contiguous spans of residues is shuffled. This means that ESM3 will randomly rearrange the order and distance between the regions of the protein where the ligand binds.

Together, these steps ensure that the original protein will no longer satisfy the prompt. This means that ESM3 will create new, unique structures that are different from the original protein.

Finally, a generation is considered a success if the backbone cRMSD, or the root mean square deviation of the backbone atoms, is less than 1.5 angstroms and the pTM, or the probability of the model being a true positive, is greater than 0.8. This means that the new structures generated by ESM3 are accurate and reliable.

In summary, ESM3 is a computational method used to generate novel structures for ligand binding sites by applying multiple transformations to the prompt. By defining a contiguous span of coordinating residues and shuffling the order and distance between them, ESM3 creates new, unique structures that are different from the original protein. The success of a generation is determined by the backbone cRMSD and the pTM.

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference to experts in the field of ligand evaluation. In this reference, we are using a total of 1024 prompts for each ligand and generating a completion for each prompt with the model we are evaluating. We are reporting Pass@ 128, which is an estimate for the fraction of ligands with at least one successful completion after 128 prompts per ligand.

To estimate this, we are using an unbiased estimator developed by Chen et al. in 1998, which is explained on page 3 of their paper. This estimator uses the success rate over 1024 prompts to provide an accurate estimate of Pass@ 128.

We have also included visualizations of randomly selected successful generations for both the base model and finetuned model in Fig. S18. These visualizations provide a clear representation of the success rate for each model and can be used to compare the performance of the two models.

In summary, we have used a total of 1024 prompts for each ligand and generated a completion for each prompt with the model we are evaluating. We have reported Pass@ 128, which is an estimate for the fraction of ligands with at least one successful completion after 128 prompts per ligand. We have used an unbiased estimator developed by Chen et al. in 1998 to estimate this value and have included visualizations of randomly selected successful generations for both the base model and finetuned model in Fig. S18.

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of preference tuning in the field of machine learning.

To understand preference tuning, we first need to understand the concept of supervised finetuning. Supervised finetuning is a technique used to improve the performance of a pre-trained model on a specific task. In this technique, the model is trained on a new dataset with a specific objective in mind, such as increasing the likelihood of high-quality samples.

Now, let's move on to preference tuning. Preference tuning is a technique used to improve the performance of a pre-trained model on a specific task by incorporating user preferences. In this technique, the model is trained on a new dataset with a specific objective in mind, such as increasing the likelihood of high-quality samples that match the user's preferences.

To judge the value of preference tuning, we also train a supervised finetuning baseline where we finetune the model to increase the likelihood of high-quality samples without the preference tuning loss. This helps us compare the performance of the preference tuned model with the supervised finetuning baseline.

In the study mentioned in the text, the researchers used three different models with different sizes - 1.4B, 7B, and 98B. They trained these models on a dataset of atomic coordination tasks and evaluated their performance at 128 generations. The results showed that the preference tuned models outperformed the supervised finetuning baseline by a significant margin.

In conclusion, preference tuning is a powerful technique used to improve the performance of pre-trained models on specific tasks by incorporating user preferences. By comparing the performance of preference tuned models with supervised finetuning baselines, we can judge the value of preference tuning and determine its effectiveness in improving model performance.

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the details of the IRPO model training process.

First, let's define some of the terms used in the description.

IRPO stands for Improved Reversible Probabilistic Optimization, which is a type of machine learning algorithm used for training models.

RMSProp is a type of optimization algorithm used in machine learning that helps to improve the efficiency of the training process.

Learning rate is a hyperparameter used in machine learning algorithms that determines the step size taken in the direction of the gradient during optimization.

Annealing is a process of gradually reducing the value of a hyperparameter over time.

Cosine schedule is a type of annealing schedule that uses a cosine function to gradually reduce the value of a hyperparameter.

Warmup is a period of time at the beginning of the training process where the learning rate is gradually increased to its final value.

Gradient norms are a measure of the magnitude of the gradient during the training process.

Clipping is a process of limiting the maximum value of a variable to a certain threshold.

Now, let's break down the details of the IRPO model training process.

Each IRPO model is trained for 1000 steps using RMSProp. This means that the algorithm will iterate through the training data 1000 times, using the RMSProp optimization algorithm to update the model parameters.

The learning rates are $1 \mathrm{e}-5,1 \mathrm{e}-5$, and $5 \mathrm{e}-6$ for the $1.4 \mathrm{~B}$, $7 \mathrm{~B}$, and 98B, respectively. This means that the learning rate is set to a specific value for each model size.

The learning rates are annealed using a cosine schedule after a 150 step warmup. This means that the learning rate is gradually reduced over time using a cosine function, starting after a 150 step warmup period.

Gradient norms are clipped to 1.0. This means that the maximum value of the gradient is limited to 1.0, which helps to prevent the model from overfitting to the training data.

In summary, the IRPO model training process involves using the RMSProp optimization algorithm to update the model parameters, with specific learning rates for each model size, annealed using a cosine schedule after a warmup period, and with gradient norms clipped to 1.0.

Thank you for watching, and we hope this explanation has been helpful!

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference used in the field of machine learning. The reference is as follows: "For all IRPO runs $\beta=0.05$ and $\alpha=0.8$. The SFT baseline uses the same hyperparameters, but with $\alpha=0.0$ to disregard the preference tuning term."

Let's break down each term in detail.

First, we have "IRPO runs". IRPO stands for Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Preference Observations. This is a machine learning algorithm that is used to learn a reward function from demonstrations of an expert's behavior. The algorithm assumes that the expert's behavior is optimal with respect to a reward function, and it tries to learn this reward function by minimizing the difference between the expert's behavior and the behavior of an agent that follows a learned policy.

Next, we have $\beta=0.05$. This is a hyperparameter that controls the trade-off between the reward function and the inverse dynamics model in the IRPO algorithm. A smaller value of $\beta$ means that the algorithm will place more weight on the reward function, while a larger value of $\beta$ means that the algorithm will place more weight on the inverse dynamics model.

Then, we have $\alpha=0.8$. This is another hyperparameter that controls the trade-off between the reward function and the inverse dynamics model. A smaller value of $\alpha$ means that the algorithm will place more weight on the reward function, while a larger value of $\alpha$ means that the algorithm will place more weight on the inverse dynamics model.

Finally, we have "The SFT baseline uses the same hyperparameters, but with $\alpha=0.0$ to disregard the preference tuning term." SFT stands for Soft Actor-Critic with Preference Observations. This is another machine learning algorithm that is used to learn a reward function from demonstrations of an expert's behavior. The algorithm is similar to IRPO, but it uses a different optimization objective. The SFT baseline is a version of the SFT algorithm that does not use the preference tuning term, which is a term that is used to encourage the learned reward function to be consistent with the expert's behavior.

In summary, the reference we discussed today is related to machine learning algorithms that are used to learn a reward function from demonstrations of an expert's behavior. The reference specifies the hyperparameters used in the IRPO algorithm and explains how the SFT baseline is a modified version of the SFT algorithm that does not use the preference tuning term.
