==============================
The proteins that exist today have developed into their present forms over the course of billions of years of natural evolution, passing through a vast evolutionary sieve.
In parallel experiments conducted over geological time, nature creates random mutations and applies selection, filtering proteins by their myriad sequences, structures, and functions.
As a result, the patterns in the proteins we observe reflect the action of the deep hidden variables of the biology that have shaped their evolution across time.
Gene sequencing surveys of Earth's natural diversity are cataloging the sequences $(1-3)$ and structures $(4,5)$ of proteins, containing billions of sequences and hundreds of millions of structures that illuminate patterns of variation across life.
------------------------------
 Proteins are complex molecules that play a crucial role in the functioning of living organisms. They are made up of chains of amino acids, which are the building blocks of life. Over billions of years, these amino acid chains have evolved through a process of natural selection, where random mutations occur and those that provide a survival advantage are passed on to future generations.

This process of evolution has resulted in the vast diversity of proteins that we see today. Each protein has a unique sequence of amino acids, which determines its structure and function. By studying the sequences and structures of proteins, scientists can gain insights into the evolutionary history of life on Earth.

Recent advances in gene sequencing technology have allowed scientists to catalog the sequences and structures of millions of proteins from different organisms. This data provides a wealth of information about the patterns of variation in proteins across different species and can help us understand how proteins have evolved over time.

In summary, the study of proteins and their evolution provides a window into the deep hidden variables of biology that have shaped the evolution of life on Earth over billions of years. By analyzing the patterns in protein sequences and structures, scientists can gain insights into the mechanisms of natural selection and the forces that have driven the evolution of life on our planet.

A consensus is building that underlying these sequences is a fundamental language of protein biology that can be understood using large language models (6-10).
A number of language models of protein sequences have now been developed and evaluated ( $9,11-14$ ).
It has been found that the representations that emerge within language models reflect the biological structure and function of proteins $(6,15,16)$, and are learned without any supervision on those properties, improving with scale $(5,17,18)$.
In artificial intelligence, scaling laws have been found that predict the growth in capabilities with increasing scale, describing a frontier in compute, parameters and data (19-21).
------------------------------
 In the field of protein biology, there is a growing consensus that there is a fundamental language that can be used to understand protein sequences. This language can be understood using large language models, which are computer programs that can analyze and interpret large amounts of data.

Several language models have been developed and evaluated, and it has been found that these models can accurately reflect the biological structure and function of proteins. This is important because it means that these models can be used to predict how proteins will behave in different situations, without the need for direct experimentation.

The language models are able to learn about the properties of proteins without any supervision, which means that they can improve their accuracy over time as more data is collected. This is known as machine learning, and it is a powerful tool for analyzing complex biological systems.

In the field of artificial intelligence, there are scaling laws that describe how the capabilities of machine learning models grow with increasing scale. These laws predict that as more data and computing power are available, the accuracy and complexity of machine learning models will increase.

Overall, the use of large language models in protein biology is an exciting development that has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of these complex molecules. By using machine learning to analyze protein sequences, scientists can gain new insights into the structure and function of proteins, and develop new treatments for diseases that are caused by protein dysfunction.

We present ESM3, a frontier multimodal generative model, that reasons over the sequences, structures, and functions of proteins.
ESM3 is trained as a generative masked language model over discrete tokens for each modality.
Structural reasoning is achieved by encoding three-dimensional atomic structure as discrete tokens rather than with the complex architecture and diffusion in three-dimensional space employed in recent predictive (22) and generative models $(14,23-25)$ of proteins.
------------------------------
 ESM3 is a new type of computer model that can generate and analyze different aspects of proteins, such as their sequences, structures, and functions. It is called a "multimodal generative model" because it can work with different types of data, such as text and 3D structures.

The model is trained using a technique called "masked language modeling", which involves hiding some parts of the input data and then predicting what those hidden parts should be. This helps the model learn how to generate new data that is similar to the input data.

One of the key features of ESM3 is that it can reason about the 3D structure of proteins using a new approach. Instead of using complex mathematical models to simulate the 3D structure, ESM3 encodes the structure as a series of discrete tokens, which are like building blocks that can be combined to create different structures.

Overall, ESM3 is a powerful tool for scientists who want to study proteins and their functions. It can help them generate new data, analyze existing data, and make predictions about how proteins will behave in different situations.

==============================
All-to-all modeling of discrete tokens is scalable, and allows ESM3 to be prompted with any combination of its modalities, enabling controllable generation of new proteins that respect combinations of prompts.
ESM3 at its largest scale was trained with $1.07 \times 10^{24}$ FLOPs on 2.78 billion proteins and 771 billion unique tokens, and has 98 billion parameters.
Scaling ESM3 to this 98 billion parameter size results in improvements in the representation of sequence, structure, and function, as well as on generative evaluations.
We find that ESM3 is highly responsive to prompts, and finds creative solutions to complex combinations of prompts, including solutions for which we can find no matching structure in nature.
------------------------------
 All-to-all modeling of discrete tokens is a technique used in machine learning to analyze and generate data. In this case, it is being used to analyze and generate proteins. ESM3 is a machine learning model that has been trained on a large dataset of proteins and tokens, which are small pieces of information that represent different aspects of proteins.

The term "scalable" means that the model can be easily adapted to handle larger datasets or more complex tasks. This is important because as more data becomes available, the model needs to be able to handle it without becoming too slow or inefficient.

The term "modalities" refers to the different types of information that the model can use as input. In this case, the model can be prompted with any combination of its modalities, which means that it can use different types of information to generate new proteins.

The term "FLOPs" stands for "floating-point operations per second" and is a measure of the computational power required to perform a task. In this case, the model was trained using a very large number of FLOPs, which indicates that it is a very powerful and complex model.

The term "tokens" refers to the small pieces of information that the model uses to analyze and generate proteins. In this case, the model was trained on a very large number of unique tokens, which means that it has a very detailed understanding of the different aspects of proteins.

The term "parameters" refers to the different settings and variables that the model uses to analyze and generate proteins. In this case, the model has a very large number of parameters, which means that it can handle very complex tasks and generate very detailed and accurate results.

Overall, the use of all-to-all modeling of discrete tokens in ESM3 allows for the generation of new proteins that respect combinations of prompts, which is a powerful tool for scientists studying proteins and their functions. The scalability of the model means that it can handle large datasets and complex tasks, and the use of different modalities and tokens allows for a detailed and accurate analysis of proteins.

We find that models at all scales can be aligned to better follow prompts.
Larger models are far more responsive to alignment, and
show greater capability to solve the hardest prompts after alignment.
------------------------------
 Sure, I'd be happy to help!

In this context, "models" refer to computer programs that are designed to perform a specific task, such as image recognition or language translation. "Alignment" refers to the process of adjusting the parameters of the model so that it better matches the desired outcome.

The statement "We find that models at all scales can be aligned to better follow prompts" means that regardless of the size or complexity of the model, it can be adjusted to better match the desired outcome.

The next sentence, "Larger models are far more responsive to alignment," means that larger models are more easily adjusted to better match the desired outcome. This is likely because larger models have more parameters that can be adjusted, giving them greater flexibility.

Finally, "show greater capability to solve the hardest prompts after alignment" means that after the model has been adjusted to better match the desired outcome, it is better able to solve difficult tasks. This is because the alignment process has improved the model's ability to recognize patterns and make accurate predictions.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

We report the generation of a new green fluorescent protein (GFP) with ESM3.
Fluorescent proteins are responsible for the glowing colors of jellyfish and corals (26) and are important tools in modern biotechnology (27).
They share an elegant structure: an eleven stranded beta barrel with a helix that threads its center, which scaffolds the formation of a light-emitting chromophore out of the protein's own atoms.
This mechanism is unique in nature-no other protein spontaneously forms a fluorescent chromophore out of its own structure-suggesting that producing fluorescence is hard even for nature.
Our new protein, which we have named esmGFP, has $36 \%$ sequence identity to Aequorea victoria GFP, and $58 \%$ sequence identity to the most similar known fluorescent protein.
Despite GFP's intense focus as a target for protein engineering over several decades, as far as we are aware, proteins this distant have only been found through the discovery of new GFPs in nature.
------------------------------
 In this study, the researchers have created a new type of green fluorescent protein (GFP) called esmGFP. GFPs are proteins that emit light and are commonly found in jellyfish and corals. They are widely used in biotechnology as tools for visualizing biological processes.

The structure of GFPs is unique in nature, consisting of an eleven-stranded beta barrel with a helix that runs through the center. This structure allows the protein to form a light-emitting chromophore, which is responsible for the glowing colors of jellyfish and corals.

The researchers have found that esmGFP has a sequence identity of 36% to Aequorea victoria GFP, which is the most well-known type of GFP. This means that esmGFP is structurally similar to Aequorea victoria GFP, but with some differences in its amino acid sequence.

The researchers also note that esmGFP has a sequence identity of 58% to the most similar known fluorescent protein. This suggests that esmGFP is a unique protein that has not been found in nature before.

Overall, the creation of esmGFP is an important development in the field of biotechnology, as it provides a new tool for visualizing biological processes.

Similar amounts of diversification among natural GFPs have occurred over predictable timescales.
Understood in these terms, the generation of a new fluorescent protein at this distance from existing proteins appears to be equivalent to simulating over 500 million years of evolution.

------------------------------
 The statement "Similar amounts of diversification among natural GFPs have occurred over predictable timescales" means that the evolution of green fluorescent proteins (GFPs) in nature has followed a consistent pattern over time. This pattern can be used to predict how much diversification (or change) has occurred among GFPs over a certain period of time.

The second part of the statement, "the generation of a new fluorescent protein at this distance from existing proteins appears to be equivalent to simulating over 500 million years of evolution," means that creating a new fluorescent protein that is significantly different from existing ones would require a very long time of evolution. This is because the amount of diversification that has occurred among natural GFPs over a certain period of time is predictable, and creating a new protein that is very different from existing ones would require a much longer period of evolution than has occurred naturally.

In summary, the statement is saying that the evolution of GFPs in nature has followed a consistent pattern over time, and creating a new fluorescent protein that is very different from existing ones would require a very long period of evolution.
