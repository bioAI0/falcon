==============================
In the following, we use $L$ to denote the sequence length, $d$ for the embedding dimension, $\{a . . b\}$ to denote the inclusive set of integers from $a$ to $b$, and $[a, b]$ an interval of real numbers. $S E(3)$ is the special Euclidean group, which we use to denote frames (Appendix A.1.6.1).
