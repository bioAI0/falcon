 This sentence is describing a program called ESM3, which can receive instructions from different sources. These sources are called "input tracks" and include things like a sequence of genetic code, coordinates for a 3D structure, information about the shape of the structure, information about the surface area of the structure, and keywords related to the function of the structure. The program can be told what to do with these different types of information.

 This sentence is describing a system that can generate prompts at different levels of detail, from very specific to more general. The system uses a model that has been trained to understand the relationships between different prompts and can create a solution that fits all of the prompts given. This is useful for tasks like generating text or images where you want to provide some guidance but also allow for creativity.###

 This sentence is discussing the evaluation of a system called ESM3. The evaluation is focused on how well ESM3 can follow instructions or prompts in different areas or "tracks" of its operation. The sentence is saying that the evaluation will look at ESM3's ability to follow prompts in each track separately.

 This sentence is about creating a set of prompts for each track using a test set of natural proteins that has been temporarily held out. The details of this process can be found in Appendix A.3.7.

 This sentence is discussing the evaluation of a set of results that were generated based on a prompt and foldability. The evaluation was done using a tool called ESMFold, which predicted the structure of the results and assigned a confidence score called the TM-score. The sentence is saying that the results were evaluated based on how well they matched the prompt and how easily they could be folded, and that the confidence of the predicted structure was measured using the TM-score.

 This sentence is discussing how they measure the consistency of different tracks in their research. They use four different metrics: cRMSD, SS3 accuracy, SASA spearman $\rho$, and keyword recovery. These metrics help them determine how well the prompt coordinates match the corresponding coordinates in the generation, how accurately the three-class secondary structure matches between the prompt and generation, how well the SASA prompt correlates with the corresponding region of the generation, and how many prompt keywords are recovered by InterProScan.

Essentially, by studying the results of unconditional generation, scientists can better understand the patterns and structures of natural proteins.

 The sentence is saying that because a model called ESM3 has been observed to accurately follow instructions, it is possible to use those instructions to make the model create proteins that are different from the ones found in nature.

 This sentence is about testing a model's ability to handle prompts that are not part of its usual training data. The phrase "out-of-distribution" means that the prompts are different from what the model was trained on. The goal is to see if the model can still perform well in these new situations.

 This sentence is about creating a set of prompts that are used to generate new structures. The prompts are made by combining two existing sets of prompts called SS8 and SASA. The new prompts are created from structures that were not used in the training set, and they are selected based on a similarity measure called TM, which is less than 0.7. The goal is to use these new prompts to generate structures that are different from the ones used in the training set.

 The sentence is describing how a computer model is able to generate coherent structures, but the structures are becoming more unique and different from the original training set. The model is able to do this with a high level of accuracy, as shown by the mean pTM value. The distribution of similarities to the training set is measured by TM-score and sequence identity, and the results show that the generated structures are becoming more novel, with less than 20% sequence identity to the nearest training set protein and a mean TM-score of 0.48. This is shown in Figure 2B at the top.

 The sentence is discussing a system called ESM3, which is able to respond to instructions from multiple sources. The sentence also mentions that ESM3 is able to consistently follow these instructions and produce high-quality results. The term "density of faithfulness" refers to how closely ESM3 follows the instructions it receives. The term "pTM" stands for "probability of target motif," which is a measure of how well ESM3 is able to produce the desired outcome. Overall, the sentence is describing the capabilities and performance of ESM3.

 The sentence is describing a process where a system called ESM3 is being used to create new proteins that are different from natural proteins. The system can be given instructions to make proteins that have different structures and sequences. The results of these instructions are shown in two graphs, one for structure and one for sequence. The blue lines in the graphs show the results of the instructions, and they are different from the red lines, which show what happens without any instructions. The instructions are based on two different things: natural structures that are not usually used to make proteins, and structures that were designed using a computer. The graphs show that the instructions are effective in creating new proteins that are different from natural proteins.

 The sentence is saying that a program called Foldseek was used to search for similarities between certain protein motifs (specific parts of a protein that have a particular function) and other proteins that contain the same motif. However, for some of these motifs, Foldseek did not find any significant similarities to other proteins. This means that these motifs may be unique or have a different function compared to other proteins with similar motifs.

 This sentence is discussing how certain structures in proteins, called motifs, can be found in unexpected places. The example given is a protease inhibitor binding site motif that is found in a beta-barrel protein, which is more similar to a membrane-bound copper transporter. This means that the motif has been added to a different part of the protein than where it is usually found. The sentence is using technical terms and scientific concepts, so it may be difficult for a non-expert to understand without further explanation.
