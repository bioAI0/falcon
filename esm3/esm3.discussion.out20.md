 Hello everyone, and welcome to this video where we'll be discussing a fascinating discovery in the field of protein design.

Proteins are the building blocks of life, and they play a crucial role in many biological processes. However, the number of possible protein structures is vast, and it's impossible for natural evolution to explore all of them.

That's where language models come in. Researchers have found that these models can access a design space of proteins that is far beyond what natural evolution has explored. This means that they can generate functional proteins that would take evolution hundreds of millions of years to discover.

In other words, language models are helping us to unlock new possibilities in protein design that were previously out of reach. This has huge implications for fields like medicine, where we can use this knowledge to develop new treatments and therapies.

So, to sum up, language models are helping us to explore new frontiers in protein design, and this could lead to some truly groundbreaking discoveries in the years to come.

 Hello everyone, and welcome to today's video. Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that might seem a bit complicated at first, but I promise it's actually quite simple once you break it down.

The concept we're going to be discussing is protein language models and their relationship to evolution. Now, I know that might sound like a mouthful, but don't worry, I'm going to explain it in a way that's easy to understand.

So, let's start with the basics. What is a protein language model? Well, in simple terms, it's a computer program that can predict the structure and function of proteins based on their amino acid sequence.

Now, you might be wondering what this has to do with evolution. Well, it turns out that these protein language models can actually help us understand how evolution works.

You see, when we look at the evolution of a particular protein, we can use these models to predict what the protein might have looked like at different points in time. This allows us to construct a model of the multitude of potential paths evolution could have followed.

However, it's important to note that these models don't explicitly work within the physical constraints of evolution. In other words, they don't take into account things like natural selection or genetic drift.

Instead, they implicitly construct a model of the potential paths evolution could have taken based on the structure and function of the protein.

So, to sum up, protein language models can help us understand the evolution of proteins by predicting their structure and function at different points in time. While they don't explicitly work within the physical constraints of evolution, they can still provide valuable insights into the potential paths evolution could have taken.

I hope that helps clarify things for you. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them in the comments section below. Thanks for watching!

 Hello everyone, and welcome to today's video. Today, we're going to be discussing a concept related to proteins that might seem a bit complex at first, but I promise to break it down for you in a way that's easy to understand.

Proteins are essential building blocks of life, and they play a crucial role in many biological processes. One way to think about proteins is to imagine them existing within an organized space. This space is like a neighborhood, where each protein is neighbored by every other protein that is one mutational event away.

What does that mean exactly? Well, let's say you have two proteins that are very similar in structure. They might be just one mutation away from each other, meaning that a single change in their genetic code could turn one protein into the other.

Now, imagine that these two proteins are neighbors in our organized space. They're close enough that they can interact with each other, and they might even work together to perform a specific function in the body.

This concept of proteins existing within an organized space is important because it helps us understand how different proteins can interact with each other and how they can evolve over time. By studying the relationships between different proteins, scientists can gain insights into how they work and how they might be used to treat diseases or improve our overall health.

So, there you have it! Proteins can be seen as existing within an organized space where each protein is neighbored by every other that is one mutational event away. I hope this explanation has been helpful, and if you have any questions, please feel free to leave them in the comments below. Thanks for watching!

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a fascinating concept in the field of biology: the structure of evolution.

Now, you might be wondering what exactly we mean by the "structure of evolution." Well, think of it this way: imagine all the proteins in the world as points in a vast, multi-dimensional space. Each protein is connected to other proteins by the paths that evolution can take between them.

This means that the structure of evolution is essentially a network within this space, connecting all proteins and showing how they can evolve and change over time.

So, why is this important? Well, understanding the structure of evolution can help us better understand how proteins and organisms evolve and adapt to their environments. It can also help us develop new treatments and therapies for diseases, as well as improve our understanding of the natural world.

We hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them below. Thanks for watching!

 Hello everyone, and welcome to this video where we'll be discussing the concept of evolution and how it relates to proteins.

Proteins are the building blocks of life, and they play a crucial role in the functioning of our bodies. They are made up of long chains of amino acids, and the sequence of these amino acids determines the protein's structure and function.

Now, when we talk about evolution, we're referring to the process by which species change over time. This can happen through a variety of mechanisms, but one of the most important is the accumulation of small changes in the DNA sequence that codes for proteins.

As these changes accumulate, they can lead to the creation of new proteins with different functions. However, it's important to note that not all changes are beneficial, and some can even be harmful.

This is where the concept of "paths that evolution can follow" comes in. Essentially, this refers to the idea that the changes that occur during evolution must be ones that allow the protein to transform into a new form without losing its overall function.

In other words, the new protein must still be able to perform its original role in the body, even if it has some new features or capabilities. If the changes are too drastic, the protein may no longer be able to do its job, which could have serious consequences for the organism.

So, to summarize, the paths that evolution can follow are the ones by which each protein transforms into the next without the collective loss of function of the system it is a part of. This is an important concept to understand if you want to fully grasp the mechanisms of evolution and how they shape the world around us.

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a fascinating topic - how a language model sees proteins.

Now, you might be wondering - what exactly is a language model? Well, a language model is a type of artificial intelligence that is designed to understand and generate human language. It's used in a variety of applications, from chatbots to voice assistants.

So, how does a language model see proteins? Well, let's start by explaining what proteins are. Proteins are large, complex molecules that are essential for life. They perform a wide range of functions in the body, from building and repairing tissues to transporting molecules and catalyzing chemical reactions.

When a language model is trained on a dataset of protein sequences, it learns to recognize patterns and relationships between different amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. It can then use this knowledge to predict the structure and function of new proteins that it hasn't seen before.

This is incredibly useful for scientists who are studying proteins, as it allows them to quickly and accurately predict the properties of new proteins without having to perform expensive and time-consuming experiments.

So, in summary, a language model sees proteins by analyzing their amino acid sequences and using this information to predict their structure and function. It's a powerful tool that is helping to advance our understanding of these essential molecules.

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a fascinating concept related to proteins and evolution.

When we talk about proteins, we're referring to the building blocks of life. These complex molecules are responsible for a wide range of functions in our bodies, from catalyzing chemical reactions to providing structural support.

Now, when we look at the data of proteins, we can think of it as filling a space. This space is densely filled in some regions, and sparsely filled in others. What does this mean?

Well, the densely filled regions represent the parts of the protein that are highly conserved, meaning they have remained relatively unchanged over time. These regions are essential for the protein's function, and any changes to them could be detrimental to the organism.

On the other hand, the sparsely filled regions represent the parts of the protein that are more flexible and can undergo changes without affecting the protein's overall function. These regions are accessible to evolution, meaning they can be modified over time to adapt to changing environmental conditions.

So, in summary, when we talk about the data of proteins filling a space, we're really talking about the parts of the protein that are essential versus those that are more flexible and can evolve over time.

I hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them below. Thanks for watching!

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a fascinating concept related to language models and evolution.

Have you ever wondered how language models are able to predict the next word in a sentence? Well, it turns out that the answer lies in the world of biology and evolution.

You see, when a language model is trying to predict the next word in a sentence, it's actually trying to predict how evolution moves through the space of possible proteins.

Proteins are the building blocks of life, and they're made up of long chains of amino acids. These amino acids can be arranged in countless different ways, and the specific arrangement of amino acids determines the protein's function.

Now, when a language model is trying to predict the next word in a sentence, it's essentially trying to predict the next amino acid in a protein sequence. This is because the next word in a sentence is determined by the context of the previous words, just like the next amino acid in a protein sequence is determined by the context of the previous amino acids.

So, in order to solve the training task of predicting the next word in a sentence, a language model must first understand how evolution moves through the space of possible proteins. This is a complex and fascinating process that involves natural selection, genetic mutations, and countless other factors.

In conclusion, the next time you use a language model to predict the next word in a sentence, remember that you're actually tapping into the power of evolution and the complex world of biology. Thank you for watching!

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that may be a bit unfamiliar to some of you: the feasibility of evolutionary paths.

When we talk about evolution, we're referring to the process by which species change over time in response to their environment. This can happen through a variety of mechanisms, such as natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow.

However, not all evolutionary paths are equally likely to occur. Some changes may be more feasible than others, depending on a variety of factors. For example, a mutation that provides a significant advantage in a particular environment may be more likely to spread throughout a population than one that has no clear benefit.

So, how do we determine whether a particular evolutionary path is feasible? This is a complex question that scientists are still working to answer. However, some of the key factors that may influence the feasibility of an evolutionary path include:

- The genetic variation present in a population
- The selective pressures acting on that population
- The rate at which mutations occur
- The likelihood of genetic recombination

By studying these and other factors, researchers can gain a better understanding of how evolution works and what factors may influence the trajectory of species over time.

So, there you have it! A brief introduction to the concept of evolutionary feasibility. We hope this video has been helpful in explaining this complex topic to non-experts. Thanks for watching!

 Title: Understanding Simulations: Computational Representations of Reality

Hello and welcome to our channel! Today, we're going to talk about simulations and how they represent reality through computational models.

First, let's define what a simulation is. A simulation is a computer program that models a real-world system or process. It allows us to study and understand complex systems by creating a virtual environment where we can manipulate variables and observe outcomes.

For example, weather forecasters use simulations to predict future weather patterns. They input data such as temperature, humidity, and air pressure into a computer model, which then generates a forecast based on these variables.

Another example is in the field of engineering, where simulations are used to test the performance of new designs before they are built. This helps engineers identify potential issues and make improvements before investing time and resources into physical prototypes.

Simulations also play a crucial role in scientific research. Scientists use simulations to study phenomena that are too dangerous, expensive, or impossible to recreate in a laboratory setting. For instance, astrophysicists use simulations to study the formation of galaxies and the evolution of the universe.

In essence, simulations provide a safe and cost-effective way to explore and understand complex systems and processes. By creating computational representations of reality, we can gain insights and make predictions that would be difficult or impossible to obtain otherwise.

So, next time you hear about a simulation being used to solve a problem or answer a question, remember that it's just a fancy way of saying "a computer model of reality."

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about a fascinating concept in the world of language models.

Have you ever wondered how languages evolve over time? Well, it turns out that there are actually models that can predict the possible outcomes of language evolution. These models are called language evolution simulators.

In a sense, these simulators can be thought of as a way to simulate the evolution of language. By inputting certain parameters and variables, the simulator can predict how a language might change over time.

So, in that sense, a language model which can predict possible outcomes of evolution can be said to be a simulator of it. It's a powerful tool that can help us better understand how languages evolve and change over time.

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to talk about ESM3, which is an emergent simulator that has been learned from solving a token prediction task on data generated by evolution.

Now, let's break that down into simpler terms. ESM3 is a type of computer program that can simulate and predict the behavior of complex systems. It was created by training a machine learning algorithm on data that was generated through a process called evolution.

Evolution is a natural process where living organisms change and adapt over time in response to their environment. In this case, the data was generated by simulating the evolution of a population of organisms, and then using that data to train the machine learning algorithm.

The result is a powerful tool that can be used to predict the behavior of complex systems, such as ecosystems, financial markets, and even social networks.

So, in summary, ESM3 is an emergent simulator that was learned from solving a token prediction task on data generated by evolution. It's a powerful tool that can be used to predict the behavior of complex systems, and it has the potential to revolutionize many fields of study.

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept related to neural networks and machine learning.

Have you ever wondered how neural networks are able to make predictions about data? Well, it's actually quite fascinating!

You see, when a neural network is trained on a dataset, it goes through a process of adjusting its internal parameters in order to minimize the difference between its predicted outputs and the actual outputs in the dataset.

As it does this, it's also discovering the underlying structure of the data. This means that it's identifying patterns and relationships within the data that allow it to make accurate predictions.

In fact, it has been theorized that neural networks are able to discover the underlying structure of the data they are trained to predict. This is a really powerful concept, as it means that neural networks can be used to uncover hidden insights and relationships within complex datasets.

So, to summarize, neural networks are not only able to make predictions about data, but they are also able to discover the underlying structure of that data. This is what makes them such a valuable tool in the field of machine learning.

Thank you for watching, and I hope this explanation has been helpful!

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a concept that might seem a bit complicated at first, but don't worry, I'm here to help you understand it.

The concept we're going to be discussing is called "token prediction task." Now, what exactly is that? Well, in simple terms, it's a task that involves predicting the next token in a sequence.

But what does that have to do with evolution? Well, that's where things get interesting. You see, in order to solve the token prediction task, a model would need to learn the deep structure that determines which steps evolution can take.

In other words, the model would need to understand the underlying rules and patterns that govern how evolution works. This is a complex and challenging task, but it's also incredibly important for understanding the natural world around us.

So, to sum up, the token prediction task is a way of testing a model's ability to understand the deep structure of evolution. It's a fascinating concept that has important implications for fields like biology, genetics, and more.

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a fascinating topic in the world of science - the generation of a new fluorescent protein.

Now, you might be wondering what a fluorescent protein is. Well, it's a protein that emits light when it's exposed to certain wavelengths of light. These proteins are incredibly useful in scientific research, as they allow scientists to track the movement and behavior of cells and other biological molecules.

So, what's so intriguing about the first chain of thought to B8 in ESM3's generation of a new fluorescent protein? Well, let's break it down.

ESM3 is a computer program that was designed to predict the structure of proteins. In this case, it was used to predict the structure of a new fluorescent protein that had never been seen before.

The first chain of thought to B8 refers to the initial prediction that ESM3 made about the structure of this new protein. B8 is a specific amino acid residue that is thought to play a key role in the protein's ability to fluoresce.

What's so intriguing about this is that ESM3 was able to accurately predict the location and importance of B8 in the protein's structure, even though it had never been seen before. This is a testament to the power of computer modeling and prediction in the field of protein science.

So, there you have it! The first chain of thought to B8 in ESM3's generation of a new fluorescent protein is a fascinating example of how computer modeling can help us understand the complex world of proteins and their functions. Thanks for watching!

 Hello and welcome to this video! Today, we're going to be discussing a reference that might seem a bit complicated at first, but don't worry, we'll break it down for you.

The reference is about a protein called B8 and its closest neighbor. It says that there are $\binom{229}{96} \times 19^{96}$ possible proteins between them. That's a really big number!

But why is this important? Well, it's because only a very small fraction of those proteins can actually have a function. This is because even just a few random mutations can cause the protein to lose its ability to fluoresce, which is a key part of its function.

So, in summary, this reference is telling us that even though there are a lot of possible proteins between B8 and its closest neighbor, only a very small fraction of them can actually do what they're supposed to do.

We hope this explanation has been helpful! If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them below. Thanks for watching!
