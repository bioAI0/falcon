 The paper "Evolutionary-scale prediction of atomic-level protein structure with a language model" by Lin et al. presents a new approach to predicting protein structures using a language model. This approach is based on the idea that the evolution of protein sequences is related to the evolution of protein structures, and that by analyzing the patterns of sequence evolution, it is possible to predict the structure of a protein.

This paper is relevant to the latest version of ESM (Evolutionary Scale Modelling) and Alphafold because both of these methods also use evolutionary information to predict protein structures. ESM is a deep learning method that uses multiple sequence alignments to predict protein structures, while Alphafold is a deep learning method that uses a combination of evolutionary information and experimental data to predict protein structures.
