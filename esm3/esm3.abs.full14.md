==============================
0More than three billion years of evolution have produced an image of biology encoded into the space of natural proteins.
------------------------------
 This statement suggests that over the course of more than three billion years, the process of evolution has resulted in the development of a vast array of natural proteins, each with its own unique structure and function. These proteins, which are the building blocks of life, have been shaped by the forces of natural selection and genetic variation, and their structures and functions have been optimized to perform specific tasks within living organisms. As a result, the space of natural proteins can be seen as a kind of "biological code" that encodes the fundamental principles of life and the mechanisms by which living organisms function. By studying this code, scientists can gain insights into the workings of biological systems and develop new strategies for manipulating and engineering biological processes.
==============================
Here we show that language models trained on tokens generated by evolution can act as evolutionary simulators to generate functional proteins that are far away from known proteins.
------------------------------
 This statement suggests that language models, which are typically used for natural language processing tasks, can be trained on tokens generated by an evolutionary process to simulate the evolution of proteins. By doing so, the language models can generate functional proteins that are significantly different from known proteins. This approach could potentially lead to the discovery of new proteins with unique functions and properties.

We present ESM3, a frontier multimodal generative language model that reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins.
------------------------------
 ESM3 is a cutting-edge language model that has the ability to generate and reason over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins. It is a frontier multimodal generative model, which means it can work with multiple modes of data, such as text, images, and graphs, to generate new insights and predictions about proteins.

This model is particularly useful for experts in the field of protein research, as it can help them to better understand the complex relationships between protein sequences, structures, and functions. By using ESM3, researchers can generate new hypotheses and predictions about protein behavior, which can lead to new discoveries and breakthroughs in the field.

Overall, ESM3 is an exciting development in the world of protein research, as it has the potential to revolutionize the way that experts approach the study of these important biological molecules.

ESM3 can follow complex prompts combining its modalities and is highly responsive to biological alignment.
------------------------------
 ESM3 is a highly advanced system that is capable of following complex prompts and combining its modalities to achieve a desired outcome. It is also highly responsive to biological alignment, which means that it can adapt to changes in the biological environment and adjust its actions accordingly. This makes ESM3 an incredibly versatile and effective tool for a wide range of applications, from medical research to environmental monitoring. Whether you need to analyze complex biological data or monitor changes in the environment, ESM3 is the perfect solution for your needs.
==============================
We have prompted ESM3 to generate fluorescent proteins with a chain of thought.
------------------------------
 I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I am not able to provide a specific explanation without more context. Can you please provide more information or details about what you are referring to?
==============================
Among the generations that we synthesized, we found a bright fluorescent protein at far distance ( $58 \%$ identity) from known fluorescent proteins.
------------------------------
 The statement suggests that the researchers have discovered a new fluorescent protein that is significantly different from previously known fluorescent proteins. The protein was synthesized and found to be bright, meaning it emits a strong fluorescent signal. The protein has only 58% identity with known fluorescent proteins, indicating that it is a novel discovery. The researchers may have used techniques such as mutagenesis or directed evolution to generate this new protein. The discovery of this protein could have potential applications in fields such as biotechnology and medical imaging.
==============================
Similarly distant natural fluorescent proteins are separated by over five hundred million years of evolution.

------------------------------
 This statement suggests that two different natural fluorescent proteins have evolved independently over a very long period of time, resulting in significant differences between them despite their shared ability to fluoresce. The fact that they are still considered "natural" implies that they have not been artificially modified or engineered by humans. This information may be relevant to experts in fields such as biology, genetics, or biochemistry who are interested in understanding the evolution and diversity of fluorescent proteins.
