------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the process of downloading and parsing various datasets for use in bioinformatics research.

First, let's talk about UniRef. UniRef is a database that provides a non-redundant set of protein sequences from various organisms. The UniRef release 2023_02 is the latest version of this database, which was downloaded from the official UniRef website.

Next, we have MGnify, which is a metagenomics analysis platform that allows researchers to analyze large datasets of microbial genomes. The MGnify version 2023_02 was downloaded and parsed from the MGnify website.

Moving on, we have the JGI dataset, which is a collection of non-restricted studies available on the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) website. All non-restricted studies available on July 31st, 2023 were downloaded and concatenated into the JGI dataset.

Finally, we have OAS, which stands for Open Antibody Sequence. OAS is a database that contains over a billion antibody sequences from 80 different studies. The OAS dataset was downloaded and clustered at 95% sequence identity, which means that sequences that are 95% similar to each other were grouped together.

In summary, we have downloaded and parsed various datasets for use in bioinformatics research, including UniRef, MGnify, JGI, and OAS. These datasets will be used to analyze and understand the complex world of genomics and proteomics. Thank you for watching!###

In all cases, data is clustered with mmseqs2 (73), with flags --kmer-per-seq 100 --cluster-mode 2 --cov-mode 1 -c 0.8 --min-seq-id $<$ seqid>.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video. Today, we will be discussing a reference that is commonly used in the field of bioinformatics. Specifically, we will be discussing the use of mmseqs2 to cluster data.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those who are not experts in this field. Mmseqs2 is a software tool that is used to perform sequence alignment and clustering. It is commonly used in bioinformatics to compare and group similar sequences.

The "--kmer-per-seq" flag is used to specify the number of k-mers (subsequences of length k) that are extracted from each sequence. In this case, the value of 100 means that 100 k-mers will be extracted from each sequence.

The "--cluster-mode" flag is used to specify the clustering mode. In this case, the value of 2 means that the sequences will be clustered based on their pairwise sequence identity.

The "--cov-mode" flag is used to specify the coverage mode. In this case, the value of 1 means that the coverage threshold will be set to 100%.

The "-c" flag is used to specify the minimum sequence identity threshold. In this case, the value of 0.8 means that sequences with a sequence identity of less than 80% will not be clustered together.

Finally, the "--min-seq-id" flag is used to specify the minimum sequence identity threshold for a sequence to be included in a cluster. In this case, the value of "<" means that the minimum sequence identity threshold will be set to the value of the "seqid" variable.

In summary, the reference we are discussing today involves using mmseqs2 to cluster data with specific flags and parameters. We hope this explanation has been helpful to those who are not experts in this field. Thank you for watching!###
==============================
In order to do cluster expansion, we separately cluster the dataset at the two levels, and perform a join to determine cluster member and cluster center based on IDs. We first sample a cluster center at the lower level, and then sample a sequence within the cluster at the higher level. As an example, for expansion of UniRef70 at $90 \%$, we first cluster UniRef at $70 \%$ sequence similarity using mmseqs linclust. Then, we cluster it separately at $90 \%$. Since each UniRef90 cluster center is by definition a UniRef70 cluster member, we filter out UniRef70 for all cluster members that are in the UniRef90 clusters. We can then drop all cluster centers without any members, which may occur due to the nondeterminism of clustering. This allows us to sample a UniRef70 center, and then a member within that cluster, of which each are $90 \%$ sequence similarity apart. For ease of dataloading, we additionally limit the number of data points within a cluster to 20 .
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on cluster expansion. In this video, we will be discussing how to perform cluster expansion using a specific example.

First, let's define some terms. Clustering is the process of grouping similar data points together based on their characteristics. In this case, we are clustering protein sequences based on their sequence similarity.

Cluster expansion is the process of taking a cluster at one level of similarity and expanding it to a higher level of similarity. For example, we may want to expand a cluster of protein sequences that are 70% similar to each other to a cluster of protein sequences that are 90% similar to each other.

To perform cluster expansion, we first cluster the dataset at the lower level of similarity. In this example, we cluster the UniRef70 dataset at 70% sequence similarity using the mmseqs linclust tool.

Next, we cluster the dataset at the higher level of similarity. In this example, we cluster the UniRef70 dataset at 90% sequence similarity using the same tool.

We then perform a join to determine the cluster member and cluster center based on IDs. We first sample a cluster center at the lower level, and then sample a sequence within the cluster at the higher level.

For example, for expansion of UniRef70 at 90% sequence similarity, we first cluster UniRef at 70% sequence similarity using mmseqs linclust. Then, we cluster it separately at 90%. Since each UniRef90 cluster center is by definition a UniRef70 cluster member, we filter out UniRef70 for all cluster members that are in the UniRef90 clusters.

We can then drop all cluster centers without any members, which may occur due to the nondeterminism of clustering. This allows us to sample a UniRef70 center, and then a member within that cluster, of which each are 90% sequence similarity apart.

For ease of data loading, we additionally limit the number of data points within a cluster to 20.

In summary, cluster expansion is a useful technique for expanding clusters of similar data points to a higher level of similarity. By clustering at the lower level, sampling a cluster center, and then sampling a sequence within the cluster at the higher level, we can expand clusters to a higher level of similarity.

As data augmention we train a 200M parameter inverse folding model and use it to create additional training examples.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of data augmentation and how it can be used to improve the performance of machine learning models.

In machine learning, data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of a dataset by creating new examples from the existing data. This is done by applying various transformations to the original data, such as rotations, flips, and translations.

In the context of this reference, the authors have used data augmentation to train a 200M parameter inverse folding model. This model is a type of neural network that is designed to predict the 3D structure of proteins from their amino acid sequences.

The inverse folding model is trained on a large dataset of protein structures, but the authors have used data augmentation to create additional training examples. This is done by applying various transformations to the existing protein structures, such as rotations and translations, to create new examples that are similar but not identical to the original structures.

By using data augmentation, the authors are able to increase the size of their training dataset and improve the performance of their inverse folding model. This is because the model is exposed to a wider range of protein structures, which helps it to learn more generalizable features and make more accurate predictions.

In summary, data augmentation is a powerful technique that can be used to improve the performance of machine learning models. In this reference, the authors have used data augmentation to train a 200M parameter inverse folding model and create additional training examples, which has helped to improve the accuracy of their protein structure predictions.
==============================
The inverse folding model uses the geometric attention layer for structure conditioning and output projection head for the sequence logits as ESM3. Unlike ESM3 the transformer stack alternates between blocks with geometric attention and standard attention. The model is trained on the sequence and structure pairs in PDB, AlphaFold-DB, and ESMAtlas, with the single training task of (and loss computed on) predicting sequence at the output given structure at the input. Model architecture and training methodology is otherwise substantially similar to ESM3.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the inverse folding model and its use of the geometric attention layer for structure conditioning and output projection head for sequence logits as ESM3.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those not specializing in this field. The geometric attention layer is a type of attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input data based on their geometric relationships. This is particularly useful in protein folding, where the 3D structure of the protein is important.

The output projection head is a component of the model that takes the output of the geometric attention layer and projects it onto a sequence of amino acids. This allows the model to predict the sequence of the protein based on its structure.

ESM3 is a previous model that also uses the geometric attention layer and output projection head, but with a different training methodology. The inverse folding model builds upon ESM3 by alternating between blocks with geometric attention and standard attention in the transformer stack.

The model is trained on a dataset of sequence and structure pairs from PDB, AlphaFold-DB, and ESMAtlas. The training task is to predict the sequence of the protein given its structure, and the loss is computed based on this prediction.

Overall, the inverse folding model is a powerful tool for predicting protein structures based on their sequences, and its use of the geometric attention layer and output projection head allows for more accurate predictions.

This model is used to generate additional sequences corresponding to each structure in the training data for ESM3 ( 5 sequences per structure for ESMAtlas and AlphaFold$\mathrm{DB}, 64$ sequences per structure for the $\mathrm{PDB})$. When training ESM3, with $50 \%$ probability the original sequence and structure pair is presented to the model as a training example. The other $50 \%$ of the time one of these 5 sequences is paired with the structure as the training example seen by ESM3.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a model used to generate additional sequences for ESM3 training data.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those not specializing in this field. ESM3 stands for Evolutionary Scale Modeling 3, which is a deep learning model used for protein structure prediction. ESMAtlas and AlphaFoldDB are two databases that contain protein structures used for training ESM3. PDB stands for Protein Data Bank, which is a public database of protein structures.

Now, let's dive into the model itself. This model is used to generate additional sequences corresponding to each structure in the training data for ESM3. For ESMAtlas and AlphaFoldDB, 5 sequences per structure are generated, while for PDB, 64 sequences per structure are generated.

When training ESM3, there is a 50% probability that the original sequence and structure pair is presented to the model as a training example. The other 50% of the time, one of these 5 or 64 sequences is paired with the structure as the training example seen by ESM3.

In summary, this model generates additional sequences for ESM3 training data, which helps improve the accuracy of protein structure prediction. Thank you for watching!###

Functional labels are obtained from InterPro (38) and InterProScan (74), both version 95.0. All annotations for UniProtKB were downloaded from the InterPro website via the 'protein2ipr.dat.gz' file. InterProScan was applied to the entirety of MGnify 90 with flags --goterms --iprlookup --pathways --disable-precalc. The resultant values are taken as ground truth functional labels for model training.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing functional labels obtained from InterPro and InterProScan.

InterPro is a database that provides functional analysis of proteins by classifying them into families and predicting domains and important sites. It integrates different protein signature recognition methods to provide a comprehensive view of protein function.

InterProScan is a software package that uses InterPro to predict protein function. It searches for matches between protein sequences and the different protein signature recognition methods integrated in InterPro.

In this study, functional labels were obtained from InterPro and InterProScan, both version 95.0. All annotations for UniProtKB were downloaded from the InterPro website via the 'protein2ipr.dat.gz' file. InterProScan was applied to the entirety of MGnify 90 with flags --goterms --iprlookup --pathways --disable-precalc. The resultant values are taken as ground truth functional labels for model training.

The --goterms flag tells InterProScan to search for Gene Ontology (GO) terms, which are standardized terms used to describe the function of genes and proteins. The --iprlookup flag tells InterProScan to search for InterPro entries, which are protein families and domains. The --pathways flag tells InterProScan to search for pathway information, which describes the biological processes in which proteins are involved. The --disable-precalc flag tells InterProScan to skip the pre-calculation step, which can speed up the analysis but may result in less accurate predictions.

The resultant values are taken as ground truth functional labels for model training. This means that the functional labels obtained from InterPro and InterProScan are considered to be accurate and are used to train machine learning models to predict protein function.

In summary, InterPro and InterProScan are powerful tools for predicting protein function. In this study, functional labels were obtained from InterPro and InterProScan and used as ground truth for model training. The --goterms, --iprlookup, and --pathways flags were used to search for different types of functional information, and the --disable-precalc flag was used to speed up the analysis.

We use all PDB chains, clustered by unique PDB ID and entity ID within the PDB structure. We filter to all structures deposited before May 1, 2020, determined by X-ray crystallography, and better than $9 \AA$ resolution. (37)
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference that may be of interest to experts in the field of structural biology.

In this reference, the authors have used all PDB chains, which refers to the Protein Data Bank, a repository of protein and nucleic acid structures. The PDB chains have been clustered by unique PDB ID and entity ID within the PDB structure. This means that the authors have grouped together chains that belong to the same protein or nucleic acid structure, based on their unique identification numbers.

The authors have also filtered their data to include only structures that were deposited before May 1, 2020, and were determined by X-ray crystallography, which is a technique used to determine the three-dimensional structure of molecules. Additionally, the structures were filtered to include only those with a resolution better than $9 \AA$, which refers to the distance between two atoms in a molecule.

Overall, this reference provides a useful dataset for experts in the field of structural biology who are interested in analyzing protein and nucleic acid structures determined by X-ray crystallography.

AlphaFoldDB is downloaded as the $v 4$ version specified on their website (4). We notice that structures with high pLDDT are disproportionately alpha helices. Therefore, we ensure globularity by measuring the number of long range ( $>12$ sequence distance) contacts in the chain. If this value is $<0.5 \mathrm{~L}$ with an $\mathrm{L}$ length protein, we omit it from our training set. We also filter out all proteins $<0.7$ pLDDT.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the use of AlphaFoldDB in protein structure prediction. AlphaFoldDB is a database of protein structures that has been predicted using the AlphaFold algorithm. In this video, we will be discussing the version 4 of AlphaFoldDB, which is the latest version available on their website.

One important aspect of protein structure prediction is the accuracy of the predicted structure. AlphaFoldDB provides a measure of the accuracy of the predicted structure called the predicted Local Distance Difference Test (pLDDT) score. This score ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a more accurate prediction.

In our analysis, we noticed that structures with high pLDDT scores tend to be alpha helices. This is because alpha helices have a regular structure that is easier to predict accurately. However, we want to ensure that our training set includes a diverse range of protein structures, not just alpha helices.

To achieve this, we measure the number of long-range contacts in the protein chain. Long-range contacts are defined as contacts between amino acid residues that are more than 12 sequence positions apart. If the number of long-range contacts is less than 0.5 times the length of the protein, we omit it from our training set. This ensures that our training set includes a diverse range of protein structures.

We also filter out all proteins with a pLDDT score less than 0.7. This is because we want to ensure that our training set includes only high-quality predictions.

In summary, we have discussed the use of AlphaFoldDB in protein structure prediction, and how we ensure the diversity and quality of our training set by filtering out structures with low pLDDT scores and low numbers of long-range contacts. Thank you for watching!###
==============================
ESMAtlas is downloaded as version v0 and v2023_02. Similarly we use $\mathrm{a}<0.7$ pLDDT filter. We use a $0.7 \mathrm{pTM}$ cutoff as well to enforce globularity. High pTM structures tends to be more compact.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the use of ESMAtlas in protein structure analysis.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those not specializing in this field. ESMAtlas is a database of protein structures that can be downloaded in different versions, such as v0 and v2023_02. These versions refer to updates and improvements made to the database over time.

Next, we use a filter called $\mathrm{a}<0.7$ pLDDT. This filter is used to identify protein structures that are likely to be accurate and reliable. The $\mathrm{a}$ value represents the confidence level of the predicted protein structure, while pLDDT stands for predicted local distance difference test. This test compares the predicted structure to the actual structure and calculates the difference in distance between corresponding atoms.

We also use a $0.7 \mathrm{pTM}$ cutoff to enforce globularity. pTM stands for predicted transmembrane helices, which are protein structures that span the cell membrane. A high pTM value indicates that the protein is likely to be embedded in the membrane, while a low pTM value indicates that the protein is likely to be soluble in the cytoplasm. By using a cutoff of 0.7, we are selecting protein structures that are more likely to be soluble and globular in shape.

Finally, we mention that high pTM structures tend to be more compact. This is because transmembrane helices are tightly packed together to form a stable structure that can withstand the harsh environment of the cell membrane.

In summary, ESMAtlas is a valuable resource for protein structure analysis, and by using filters such as $\mathrm{a}<0.7$ pLDDT and a $0.7 \mathrm{pTM}$ cutoff, we can identify accurate and reliable protein structures that are likely to be soluble and globular in shape. Thank you for watching!###
==============================
Structural data also includes any functional labels that exist for the corresponding sequence.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of structural data and its relation to functional labels in the field of bioinformatics.

Structural data refers to the three-dimensional structure of biological molecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates. This information is crucial for understanding the function of these molecules and their interactions with other molecules in the body.

Functional labels, on the other hand, refer to the specific roles that these molecules play in biological processes. For example, a protein may have a label such as "enzyme" or "receptor" depending on its function.

When we talk about structural data including functional labels, we are referring to the fact that the three-dimensional structure of a molecule can provide important information about its function. For example, the shape of a protein can determine how it interacts with other molecules, and therefore what role it plays in a biological process.

In summary, structural data and functional labels are both important concepts in the field of bioinformatics, and understanding their relationship can help us better understand the function of biological molecules and their role in the body.

For solvent accessibility surface area, we use the ShrakeRupley rolling probe algorithm as implemented in biotite (75). This generates a set of real numbers, or a nan value when structural coordinates are not provided. Similarly, SS8 labels are generated using the mkdssp tool (76) and taken as ground truth labels.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the ShrakeRupley rolling probe algorithm and the mkdssp tool. These are two important tools used in the field of protein structure analysis.

Let's start with the ShrakeRupley rolling probe algorithm. This algorithm is used to calculate the solvent accessibility surface area of a protein. Solvent accessibility surface area refers to the surface area of a protein that is exposed to the surrounding solvent. This is an important parameter to consider when studying protein structure and function.

The ShrakeRupley algorithm works by rolling a probe of a certain radius over the protein surface and calculating the surface area that is accessible to the probe. This is done for different probe radii, and the results are combined to give a final solvent accessibility surface area value.

Now, let's talk about the mkdssp tool. This tool is used to assign secondary structure labels to a protein structure. Secondary structure refers to the local three-dimensional structure of a protein, such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets.

The mkdssp tool uses a set of rules to assign secondary structure labels to each residue in a protein structure. These labels are then used to analyze the protein structure and function.

In summary, the ShrakeRupley rolling probe algorithm and the mkdssp tool are two important tools used in protein structure analysis. The ShrakeRupley algorithm calculates the solvent accessibility surface area of a protein, while the mkdssp tool assigns secondary structure labels to a protein structure. These tools are essential for understanding the structure and function of proteins, which are important for many biological processes.

In both cases, we use the set of high quality predicted structures in AlphaFoldDB and ESMAtlas. We split our datasets into structural and sequence data. Structural data is shown separately in order to weight the ratios of structural data (mostly synthetic) properly with the amount of sequence data (mostly real).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the use of AlphaFoldDB and ESMAtlas in predicting protein structures.

First, let's define some terms. AlphaFoldDB is a database of protein structures predicted by AlphaFold, a deep learning algorithm developed by DeepMind. ESMAtlas is another database of protein structures predicted by a different algorithm called ESM-1.

In both cases, we use the set of high quality predicted structures in these databases. We split our datasets into two categories: structural data and sequence data. Structural data refers to the predicted protein structures themselves, while sequence data refers to the amino acid sequences that make up the proteins.

It's important to note that the structural data is mostly synthetic, meaning it was generated by the algorithms rather than observed in real proteins. On the other hand, the sequence data is mostly real, meaning it was obtained from actual protein sequences.

To properly weight the ratios of structural data to sequence data, we show the structural data separately. This allows us to ensure that the amount of structural data is not overwhelming the amount of sequence data, which could lead to biased results.

Overall, the use of AlphaFoldDB and ESMAtlas in predicting protein structures is an exciting development in the field of structural biology. By using these databases, researchers can gain valuable insights into the structures and functions of proteins, which can have important implications for drug discovery and disease research.

An oversight was that we did not manage to apply these augmentations to PDB. However, since PDB constituted a relatively small portion of our training data, and these structural conditioning tasks did not depend on precise sidechain positions, we reasoned that high confidence synthetic structures would perform equally well and annotation of PDB was not necessary.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference to experts in the field of protein structure prediction. In this reference, the authors discuss an oversight in their study where they did not apply certain augmentations to the Protein Data Bank, or PDB.

For those who may not be familiar with the PDB, it is a database of protein structures that have been experimentally determined. It is a valuable resource for researchers who are interested in understanding the structure and function of proteins.

The authors of this study were using the PDB as a source of training data for their protein structure prediction model. However, they realized that they had not applied certain augmentations to the PDB data, which could have improved the performance of their model.

The augmentations in question were structural conditioning tasks, which are designed to improve the accuracy of protein structure predictions by incorporating information about the structure of related proteins. These tasks do not require precise information about the positions of sidechains, which are the chemical groups that protrude from the backbone of a protein.

Despite the oversight, the authors reasoned that high confidence synthetic structures would perform equally well and annotation of PDB was not necessary. This means that they believed that using synthetic structures that were highly likely to be accurate would be just as effective as using the PDB data with the augmentations applied.

In summary, the authors of this study realized that they had not applied certain augmentations to the PDB data in their protein structure prediction model. However, they believed that using high confidence synthetic structures would be just as effective as using the PDB data with the augmentations applied.

We keep track of validation set performance on a set of held out sequences from each training set, UniRef, MGnify, and JGI. In order to properly hold out a sufficiently diverse set of validation proteins, we first sample 25000 proteins from each set. Then we use mmseqs easy-search to filter out proteins from this set with a $70 \%$ sequence identity threshold. We choose the set of proteins from our training set to be the "query" set, and the set of validation proteins as our "target" set for mmseqs. We use the flags --alignment-mode 3 -c 0.8 \{cov-mode 0 --max-seqs 300 --max-accept 3 --start-sens 2 -s 7 --sens-steps 3.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the validation set performance of our training set, UniRef, MGnify, and JGI.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those not specializing in this field. A validation set is a set of data that is used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. It is separate from the training set, which is used to train the model.

UniRef, MGnify, and JGI are all databases of protein sequences. UniRef is a non-redundant protein sequence database that groups together sequences that are highly similar to each other. MGnify is a metagenomic database that contains sequences from environmental samples. JGI is a database of protein sequences from the Joint Genome Institute.

Now, let's talk about how we keep track of validation set performance. We first sample 25,000 proteins from each set of sequences. This ensures that we have a diverse set of validation proteins.

Next, we use a tool called mmseqs easy-search to filter out proteins from this set that have a sequence identity threshold of 70%. This means that we only keep proteins that are at least 70% different from each other.

We then choose the set of proteins from our training set to be the "query" set, and the set of validation proteins as our "target" set for mmseqs. We use the flags --alignment-mode 3 -c 0.8 \{cov-mode 0 --max-seqs 300 --max-accept 3 --start-sens 2 -s 7 --sens-steps 3 to run the mmseqs tool.

The --alignment-mode 3 flag tells mmseqs to use a fast alignment mode. The -c 0.8 flag sets the coverage threshold to 80%, meaning that we only consider alignments that cover at least 80% of the query sequence. The \{cov-mode 0 flag tells mmseqs to use the default coverage mode.

The --max-seqs 300 flag sets the maximum number of sequences to consider for each query sequence. The --max-accept 3 flag sets the maximum number of hits to accept for each query sequence. The --start-sens 2 flag sets the starting sensitivity threshold to 2. The -s 7 flag sets the sensitivity threshold to 7. The --sens-steps 3 flag sets the number of sensitivity steps to 3.

By using these flags, we are able to run mmseqs and evaluate the performance of our training set on the validation set. We hope this explanation has been helpful in understanding how we keep track of validation set performance. Thank you for watching!###

This query is designed such that early stopping in mmseqs will not affect if we find a hit in the "query" training set.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a query designed to ensure that early stopping in mmseqs does not affect the identification of hits in the "query" training set.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those not specializing in this field.

mmseqs stands for "massively multi-threaded sequence search" and is a software tool used for sequence alignment and database searching. It is commonly used in bioinformatics research to identify similarities between sequences.

Early stopping is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting of a model. In the context of mmseqs, early stopping is used to stop the search process before it has completed all possible alignments, in order to save time and computational resources.

A hit in the "query" training set refers to a sequence that is identified as similar to the query sequence, which is the sequence being searched for in the database.

Now, let's discuss the query design. The query is designed in a way that ensures that early stopping in mmseqs will not affect the identification of hits in the "query" training set. This means that even if the search process is stopped early, all hits in the training set will still be identified.

This is important because if early stopping were to affect the identification of hits in the training set, it could lead to inaccurate results and potentially incorrect conclusions being drawn from the data.

In summary, the query design ensures that early stopping in mmseqs does not affect the identification of hits in the "query" training set, which is crucial for accurate and reliable results in bioinformatics research.

Thank you for watching and we hope this explanation has been helpful.

Train purges are run to generate a list of blacklisted UniRef, MGnify, and JGI IDs, which are removed from the training set.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of train purges and how they are used to generate a list of blacklisted UniRef, MGnify, and JGI IDs.

First, let's define some of the terms used in this statement. UniRef, MGnify, and JGI are all databases that contain information about proteins and their sequences. UniRef is a non-redundant protein sequence database that clusters protein sequences based on their similarity. MGnify is a metagenomics analysis platform that allows users to analyze and interpret metagenomic data. JGI is the Joint Genome Institute, which is a research facility that focuses on genomics and systems biology.

Now, let's talk about train purges. Train purges are a process used in machine learning to improve the accuracy of a model. In the context of protein sequence analysis, train purges are used to remove sequences from the training set that are not relevant or are likely to cause errors in the model.

To generate a list of blacklisted UniRef, MGnify, and JGI IDs, train purges are run on the training set. This process involves analyzing the sequences in the training set and identifying those that are likely to cause errors in the model. These sequences are then removed from the training set, and their UniRef, MGnify, and JGI IDs are added to a blacklist.

The blacklist is used to prevent these sequences from being included in future training sets, which helps to improve the accuracy of the model. By removing irrelevant or error-prone sequences from the training set, the model can focus on learning from the most relevant and accurate data.

In summary, train purges are a process used in machine learning to improve the accuracy of a model. In the context of protein sequence analysis, train purges are used to generate a list of blacklisted UniRef, MGnify, and JGI IDs, which are removed from the training set to improve the accuracy of the model.

The dataset counts in Table S3 are computed after limiting the large clusters to 20 . The number of tokens are computed by multiplying the number of sequences with the average length of the dataset.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the dataset counts in Table S3. This table is commonly used in the field of bioinformatics and is often referenced in research papers and studies.

To begin, let's define some key terms that may not be obvious to those who are not familiar with this field. The first term is "dataset counts." This refers to the number of sequences or data points that are included in a particular dataset. In the context of Table S3, this refers to the number of sequences that were analyzed in a particular study.

The next term is "large clusters." These are groups of sequences that are highly similar to each other and are often grouped together for analysis purposes. In Table S3, the dataset counts are computed after limiting the large clusters to 20. This means that any clusters that contain more than 20 sequences are excluded from the analysis.

Finally, we have the term "tokens." In the context of Table S3, tokens refer to the number of sequences that are included in the dataset. This number is computed by multiplying the number of sequences with the average length of the dataset.

So, to summarize, the dataset counts in Table S3 refer to the number of sequences that were analyzed in a particular study, after limiting the large clusters to 20. The number of tokens is computed by multiplying the number of sequences with the average length of the dataset.

Thank you for watching and we hope this explanation has been helpful!
==============================
In order to compute the approximate number of sequences and tokens seen during training, we first compute the number of times the dataset is repeated at the cluster level. Given the the number of repeats, we know the expected number of unique samples seen when sampling with replacement is $n\left(1-\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^{k}\right)$ with a cluster of size $n$ and $k$ items selected. Computing this on the size of each cluster and number of dataset repeats results in the approximate number of tokens we present as presented in Table S4. Our largest model is trained on all of this data, while our smaller models use a portion of it depending on the model's token budget.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a script that can be used to explain a reference to experts in the field of machine learning.

The reference we will be discussing is related to computing the approximate number of sequences and tokens seen during training. This is an important aspect of training machine learning models, as it helps us understand how much data the model has been exposed to and how well it is likely to perform on new data.

To compute the approximate number of sequences and tokens seen during training, we first need to compute the number of times the dataset is repeated at the cluster level. This is because the dataset is typically divided into smaller clusters, and each cluster is repeated multiple times during training.

Once we know the number of repeats, we can use a formula to estimate the expected number of unique samples seen when sampling with replacement. This formula is $n\left(1-\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^{k}\right)$, where $n$ is the size of the cluster and $k$ is the number of items selected.

By computing this formula for each cluster and each dataset repeat, we can get an estimate of the total number of tokens presented during training. This estimate is presented in Table S4.

It's worth noting that our largest model is trained on all of this data, while our smaller models use a portion of it depending on the model's token budget. This is because smaller models may not have the capacity to handle all of the data, and so we need to limit the amount of data they are exposed to.

In summary, computing the approximate number of sequences and tokens seen during training is an important aspect of machine learning, and can help us understand how well our models are likely to perform on new data. By using the formula we discussed and considering the size of our dataset and the capacity of our models, we can make informed decisions about how much data to expose our models to during training.

In the masked generative framework, corruption is applied to each input to the model. To enable generation, the amount of noise applied to an input is sampled from a distribution with probability mass on all values between 0 and 1 .
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on the masked generative framework. In this framework, corruption is applied to each input to the model. Corruption refers to the process of adding noise or randomness to the input data. This is done to prevent the model from simply memorizing the input data and to encourage it to learn the underlying patterns and structures in the data.

To enable generation, the amount of noise applied to an input is sampled from a distribution with probability mass on all values between 0 and 1. This means that the amount of noise added to each input is randomly selected from a range of values between 0 and 1. This allows the model to generate new data that is similar to the input data but not identical.

In summary, the masked generative framework is a technique used in machine learning to generate new data that is similar to the input data but not identical. This is achieved by adding noise or randomness to the input data and sampling the amount of noise from a distribution with probability mass on all values between 0 and 1.

We select various noise schedules for different tracks with several goals in mind. First, ESM3 should see all combinations of tracks as input and output, enabling it to generate and predict based on arbitrary inputs. Second, ESM3 should maintain a balance of strong representation learning and high quality generations. Third, the type of inputs provided should be representative of what users would like to prompt the model with.
In initial experimentation, we found that a fixed $15 \%$ noise schedule led to poor generation results, while a linear noise schedule where probability of each mask rate was constant led to good generation but poor representation learning results. We find a good trade-off between representation learning and generation by sampling the noise schedule from a mixture distribution. $80 \%$ of the time, the mask rate is sampled from a $\beta(3,9)$ distribution with mean mask rate $25 \%$. $20 \%$ of the time, the mask rate is sampled from a uniform distribution, resulting in an average overall mask rate of $30 \%$.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the use of noise schedules in the field of machine learning. Specifically, we will be looking at how noise schedules are used in the ESM3 model to generate and predict based on arbitrary inputs.

First, let's define what we mean by noise schedules. In machine learning, noise schedules refer to the process of adding random noise to the input data during training. This is done to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model becomes too specialized to the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data.

In the case of the ESM3 model, noise schedules are used to ensure that the model can generate and predict based on arbitrary inputs. This means that the model should be able to handle a wide range of inputs, including those that it has not seen before.

To achieve this, the ESM3 model uses a mixture distribution to sample the noise schedule. 80% of the time, the mask rate is sampled from a beta distribution with a mean mask rate of 25%. The beta distribution is a probability distribution that is commonly used in statistics to model the probability of an event occurring. In this case, the beta distribution is used to model the probability of a mask rate occurring.

The remaining 20% of the time, the mask rate is sampled from a uniform distribution. This means that the mask rate is equally likely to be any value between 0% and 100%. The overall result is an average mask rate of 30%.

By using a mixture distribution to sample the noise schedule, the ESM3 model is able to achieve a good trade-off between representation learning and generation. Representation learning refers to the process of learning a good representation of the input data, while generation refers to the process of generating new data based on the learned representation.

In summary, noise schedules are an important tool in machine learning that are used to prevent overfitting and ensure that models can handle a wide range of inputs. The ESM3 model uses a mixture distribution to sample the noise schedule, which allows it to achieve a good balance between representation learning and generation.

The noise schedules applied to each input are listed in Table S6. For the structure coordinate track, we also modify the noise to be applied as span dropping, as opposed to i.i.d over the sequence with $50 \%$ probability. This ensures that the model sees contiguous regions of masked and provided coordinates, which better mimics the types of inputs users may provide.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the reference to experts on YouTube. In this reference, we will be explaining the noise schedules applied to each input, which are listed in Table S6.

Firstly, let's define what we mean by noise schedules. Noise schedules refer to the amount of noise or randomness that is added to the input data during the training process of a machine learning model. This is done to prevent overfitting and to ensure that the model can generalize well to new data.

In this specific reference, the noise schedules are applied to the structure coordinate track. The structure coordinate track refers to the coordinates of the protein structure being analyzed. The noise is applied to these coordinates to simulate the types of inputs that users may provide.

Now, let's discuss the modification made to the noise schedule. Instead of applying the noise as i.i.d (independent and identically distributed) over the sequence with a 50% probability, the noise is applied as span dropping. Span dropping refers to the process of randomly dropping out contiguous regions of the input data. This ensures that the model sees contiguous regions of masked and provided coordinates, which better mimics the types of inputs users may provide.

In summary, the noise schedules applied to each input are modified to better simulate the types of inputs that users may provide. This is done by applying span dropping to the noise schedule for the structure coordinate track. Thank you for watching and we hope this explanation was helpful.###
==============================
Along with applying noise to each track, we want to ensure ESM3 is able to perform well when some tracks are not provided at all (e.g. to perform structure prediction when no structure is provided as input). We enable this by wholly dropping out some tracks with varying probabilities, listed in Table S6.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference to experts in the field of ESM3. In this reference, the authors discuss the importance of applying noise to each track and ensuring that ESM3 is able to perform well even when some tracks are not provided at all.

To achieve this, the authors use a technique called dropout, which involves wholly dropping out some tracks with varying probabilities. The probabilities for each track are listed in Table S6.

Now, let's break down some of the terms used in this reference. ESM3 stands for Evolutionary Scale Modeling 3, which is a computational method used to predict the structure of proteins.

The term "tracks" refers to the different types of data that are used as input to the ESM3 model. These tracks can include information about the amino acid sequence of the protein, as well as information about the evolutionary history of the protein.

The term "noise" refers to random fluctuations that are added to the input data in order to improve the performance of the model. This is a common technique in machine learning and is used to prevent the model from overfitting to the training data.

Finally, the term "dropout" refers to the technique used by the authors to randomly drop out some of the input tracks during training. This helps to prevent the model from relying too heavily on any one type of input data and can improve its ability to generalize to new data.

In summary, the authors of this reference use a technique called dropout to improve the performance of the ESM3 model when some input tracks are not provided. This involves randomly dropping out some tracks with varying probabilities, as listed in Table S6.

We apply gaussian noise with standard deviation 0.1 to all coordinates the model takes as input.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of applying Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 0.1 to all coordinates that a model takes as input.

First, let's define what Gaussian noise is. Gaussian noise, also known as normal noise, is a type of random noise that follows a Gaussian distribution. It is commonly used in signal processing and machine learning to simulate real-world noise and to prevent overfitting of models.

Now, let's talk about the standard deviation. The standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the data is from the mean. In the context of Gaussian noise, the standard deviation determines the amount of noise that is added to the input data. A higher standard deviation means more noise is added, while a lower standard deviation means less noise is added.

In this specific case, we are applying Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 0.1 to all coordinates that the model takes as input. This means that we are adding a small amount of noise to the input data to prevent overfitting and to make the model more robust to real-world noise.

Overall, applying Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 0.1 to all coordinates that a model takes as input is a common technique used in machine learning to improve the performance and generalization of models.

An interesting use case of generative protein models involves conditioning on key structural information, such as an active site, and generating the sequence and structure of a protein that contains this information. It is possible to define an atomic coordination task as 3 residues which are mutually in contact in structure space ( $C \alpha-C \alpha$ distance $<6 \AA$ ), but are distant in sequence space ( $\geq 10$ positions apart) (23). Training on this conditioning may enable the model to better perform the type of atomic coordination required for active site sampling.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on generative protein models. Today, we'll be discussing an interesting use case of these models that involves conditioning on key structural information, such as an active site, and generating the sequence and structure of a protein that contains this information.

To understand this concept, let's first define some terms. A protein is a complex molecule made up of amino acids that are linked together in a specific sequence. The sequence of amino acids determines the protein's structure and function. An active site is a specific region on a protein where chemical reactions occur. It is often the site where drugs or other molecules bind to the protein.

Now, let's talk about generative protein models. These models are a type of machine learning algorithm that can generate new protein sequences and structures based on a set of input data. They are trained on large datasets of protein sequences and structures, and can learn to generate new sequences and structures that are similar to the ones in the training data.

In this use case, we are conditioning the generative protein model on key structural information, such as an active site. This means that we are providing the model with information about the location and structure of the active site, and asking it to generate a new protein sequence and structure that contains this information.

To do this, we define an atomic coordination task as three residues that are mutually in contact in structure space (meaning they are close to each other in the 3D structure of the protein), but are distant in sequence space (meaning they are far apart in the linear sequence of amino acids that make up the protein). This task is important because it allows the model to learn how to generate sequences and structures that are compatible with the active site.

By training the generative protein model on this conditioning, we can enable it to better perform the type of atomic coordination required for active site sampling. This means that the model will be better able to generate new protein sequences and structures that are compatible with the active site, and that can potentially be used to design new drugs or other molecules that interact with the protein.

In summary, generative protein models are a powerful tool for generating new protein sequences and structures, and can be used to design new drugs or other molecules that interact with proteins. By conditioning the model on key structural information, such as an active site, we can enable it to better perform the type of atomic coordination required for active site sampling, and generate new sequences and structures that are compatible with the active site.
==============================
While this task will be sampled with some probability under the standard noise schedules, we also manually sample the task with $5 \%$ probability whenever a structure is available. If the task is sampled and a valid atomic coordination triplet is found, the structure coordinates for that triplet are shown to the model. For each residue in the triplet, the adjacent residues are also independently shown with $50 \%$ probability, which leads to a total size of between 3 and 9 residues. All other structure coordinates are masked. Normal masking is applied to the other tracks.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference related to the field of protein structure prediction. In this reference, the authors describe a task that is sampled with some probability under the standard noise schedules. This means that the task is randomly selected based on a predetermined probability distribution.

However, the authors also manually sample the task with a 5% probability whenever a structure is available. This means that if a structure is available, the task is selected with a 5% probability.

If the task is sampled and a valid atomic coordination triplet is found, the structure coordinates for that triplet are shown to the model. An atomic coordination triplet refers to a group of three atoms that are in close proximity to each other and are involved in a specific chemical interaction.

For each residue in the triplet, the adjacent residues are also independently shown with a 50% probability. This means that there is a 50% chance that the residues adjacent to the triplet will also be shown to the model.

All other structure coordinates are masked, which means that they are hidden from the model. Normal masking is applied to the other tracks, which means that the other tracks are also hidden from the model.

In summary, the authors are describing a process where a task is randomly selected with a predetermined probability distribution, but is also manually selected with a 5% probability if a structure is available. If a valid atomic coordination triplet is found, the structure coordinates for that triplet are shown to the model, along with a 50% chance of showing the adjacent residues. All other structure coordinates are masked.

Predicting and generating binding interfaces is another important task for generative protein models. To help with this capability, we add computational data augmentation that simulates the binding interface task.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on predicting and generating binding interfaces using generative protein models. In this video, we will be discussing the importance of predicting and generating binding interfaces and how computational data augmentation can help with this task.

First, let's define what we mean by binding interfaces. Binding interfaces refer to the specific regions of a protein that interact with other molecules, such as ligands or other proteins. These interactions are crucial for many biological processes, such as enzymatic reactions, signal transduction, and protein-protein interactions.

Now, let's talk about generative protein models. These are computational models that can generate new protein structures based on a set of input parameters. These models are trained on large datasets of protein structures and can be used to predict the structure of new proteins or to generate new protein structures that have specific properties, such as binding affinity or stability.

One important task for generative protein models is predicting and generating binding interfaces. This is because the binding interface is often the most important region of a protein for its function. By accurately predicting and generating binding interfaces, we can better understand how proteins interact with other molecules and design new proteins with specific binding properties.

To help with this task, we can use computational data augmentation. This involves simulating the binding interface task by generating new protein structures that have similar binding interfaces to the original protein. By doing this, we can increase the diversity of the training data and improve the performance of the generative protein model.

In summary, predicting and generating binding interfaces is an important task for generative protein models. By using computational data augmentation, we can improve the performance of these models and better understand how proteins interact with other molecules. Thank you for watching!###
==============================
We define a tertiary interface as one involving a long range contact $(C \alpha-C \alpha$ distance $<8 \AA, \geq 24$ sequence positions). When this task is sampled ( $5 \%$ probability whenever a structure is present), a long range contact is found, then the chain is split into two chains, each containing one side of the contact interface. Suppose the contacting positions are given by the indices $i, j$. Then the first chain will contain residues between [RANDINT $(1, i-3)$, RANDINT $(i+3, j-15)$ ], while the second chain will contain residues between [RANDINT $(i+15, j-3)$, RANDINT $(j+15, L)$ ]. This ensures there is always a residue gap between the two pseudochains. A chainbreak token "-" is inserted to represent the residue gap.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of a tertiary interface in the field of protein structure.

A tertiary interface refers to a specific type of interaction between two or more protein chains. This interaction involves a long-range contact, which means that the distance between the two chains is greater than 8 angstroms and there are at least 24 sequence positions between them.

When this type of interaction is present in a protein structure, it is often referred to as a "long-range contact" and is typically found in proteins that have multiple domains or subunits.

In order to study these interactions, researchers often use computational methods to simulate the behavior of protein chains. One common approach is to split the chain into two separate chains, each containing one side of the contact interface.

To do this, the contacting positions are first identified using the indices $i$ and $j$. The first chain is then created by selecting residues between [RANDINT $(1, i-3)$] and [RANDINT $(i+3, j-15)$], while the second chain is created by selecting residues between [RANDINT $(i+15, j-3)$] and [RANDINT $(j+15, L)$].

This ensures that there is always a residue gap between the two pseudochains, which is represented by a chainbreak token "-".

Overall, the concept of a tertiary interface is an important one in the field of protein structure, as it helps researchers to better understand the complex interactions between protein chains and how they contribute to the overall function of the protein.

To encourage the model to learn to represent residue gaps using the chainbreak token, we introduce a task which randomly splits a single chain into multiple subchains.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a technique used in the field of protein structure prediction. Specifically, we will be talking about how to encourage a model to learn to represent residue gaps using the chainbreak token.

First, let's define some terms. Protein structure prediction is the process of predicting the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. Residue gaps refer to the spaces between amino acid residues in a protein structure. These gaps can occur due to missing data or because the protein is flexible and can adopt different conformations.

Now, let's talk about the chainbreak token. This is a special symbol that is used to represent a break in the protein chain. It is used to indicate where one subchain ends and another begins.

To encourage the model to learn to represent residue gaps using the chainbreak token, we introduce a task which randomly splits a single chain into multiple subchains. This task forces the model to learn how to represent gaps in the protein structure using the chainbreak token.

In summary, by introducing a task that randomly splits a single chain into multiple subchains, we can encourage the model to learn to represent residue gaps using the chainbreak token. This technique is useful in the field of protein structure prediction and can help improve the accuracy of predicted protein structures.

First, a number of chains to sample is sampled from a geometric distribution with probability 0.9 , up to a maximum of 9 possible chains. If the number of chains sampled is 1 , no additional transformations are applied. A minimum separation of 10 residues between chains is defined. Sequence lengths of the chains along with gaps are sampled from a dirichlet distribution to maintain identically distributed sequence lengths for each chain. This transformation is applied to all samples.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference to experts in the field of bioinformatics. In this reference, the authors have used a geometric distribution to sample the number of chains to be used in their analysis. The probability of sampling a chain is set at 0.9, which means that there is a 90% chance that a chain will be sampled. The maximum number of chains that can be sampled is set at 9. If only one chain is sampled, no additional transformations are applied. The authors have also defined a minimum separation of 10 residues between chains. This means that if two chains are sampled, they must be at least 10 residues apart from each other. To maintain identically distributed sequence lengths for each chain, the authors have used a dirichlet distribution to sample sequence lengths and gaps. This transformation is applied to all samples. Thank you for watching and we hope this explanation has been helpful.

==============================
In the case that multiple chains are provided to the model from either the interface sampling or pseudo-multimer augmentation tasks, we mask the geometric attention layer to prevent the model from attending to cross-chain coordinates. This simulates tasks where the structure of individual chains is known, but the interface is unknown.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference to experts in the field of protein structure prediction. Specifically, we will be looking at a technique used to prevent a model from attending to cross-chain coordinates when multiple chains are provided to the model from either the interface sampling or pseudo-multimer augmentation tasks.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those not specializing in this field. Protein structure prediction is the process of predicting the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. A protein is made up of one or more chains, which are sequences of amino acids that fold into a specific shape. The interface between two chains is the region where they interact with each other.

Now, let's dive into the technique itself. When multiple chains are provided to the model, it can be difficult for the model to determine which chain it should be focusing on. To prevent the model from attending to cross-chain coordinates, we mask the geometric attention layer. This means that we prevent the model from looking at coordinates that are not within the same chain.

This technique is useful in tasks where the structure of individual chains is known, but the interface is unknown. By masking the geometric attention layer, we can simulate this scenario and force the model to focus on the individual chains rather than the interface between them.

In summary, masking the geometric attention layer is a technique used in protein structure prediction to prevent a model from attending to cross-chain coordinates when multiple chains are provided to the model. This is useful in tasks where the structure of individual chains is known, but the interface is unknown.

We train all models using AdamW optimizer (77), with the following hyperparameters: $\beta_{1}=0.9, \beta_{2}=0.95$. We use a weight decay of 0.01 and gradient clipping of 1.0. We employ $5 \mathrm{~K}$ to $20 \mathrm{~K}$ warmup steps until reaching the maximum learning rate, and utilize a cosine decay scheduler to decay LR to $10 \%$ of the maximum learning rate by the end of training.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the use of the AdamW optimizer in training models.

First, let's define what an optimizer is. An optimizer is a mathematical algorithm used to update the parameters of a model during training. The goal of an optimizer is to minimize the loss function, which is a measure of how well the model is performing.

Now, let's talk about the AdamW optimizer. AdamW stands for Adam with weight decay. Adam is a popular optimizer that is known for its ability to handle noisy data and adapt to changing gradients. Weight decay is a regularization technique that helps prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function.

The AdamW optimizer combines the benefits of Adam and weight decay. It uses the same update rule as Adam, but adds a weight decay term to the gradient. The weight decay term is multiplied by a hyperparameter called $\beta_{2}$.

In the script, we set $\beta_{1}=0.9$ and $\beta_{2}=0.95$. These are the default values recommended by the authors of the AdamW paper. $\beta_{1}$ controls the exponential moving average of past squared gradients, while $\beta_{2}$ controls the exponential moving average of past gradients.

We also use a weight decay of 0.01. This means that we add a penalty term to the loss function that is equal to 0.01 times the sum of the squared weights. This helps prevent overfitting by discouraging large weights.

To prevent the gradients from exploding, we use gradient clipping. Gradient clipping is a technique that limits the maximum value of the gradients during training. In the script, we set the gradient clipping to 1.0, which means that we limit the maximum value of the gradients to 1.0.

Finally, we use warmup steps and a cosine decay scheduler to adjust the learning rate during training. Warmup steps are a technique that gradually increases the learning rate from an initial value to the maximum value. In the script, we use $5 \mathrm{~K}$ to $20 \mathrm{~K}$ warmup steps until reaching the maximum learning rate. We then use a cosine decay scheduler to decay the learning rate to $10 \%$ of the maximum learning rate by the end of training.

In summary, the AdamW optimizer is a powerful tool for training models. It combines the benefits of Adam and weight decay, and uses warmup steps and a cosine decay scheduler to adjust the learning rate during training. By using the AdamW optimizer, we can improve the performance of our models and prevent overfitting.

Our training codebase uses Pytorch. We use Pytorch's FSDP (78) implementation for data parallelism. We also use custom components from the TransformerEngine (79) library.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the technical details of our training codebase. Our codebase utilizes Pytorch, which is an open-source machine learning library that provides a wide range of tools for deep learning.

One of the key features of Pytorch is its ability to perform data parallelism, which allows us to distribute the workload across multiple GPUs. To achieve this, we use Pytorch's FSDP implementation, which stands for Fully Sharded Data Parallelism. This implementation allows us to efficiently distribute the workload across multiple GPUs while minimizing communication overhead.

In addition to FSDP, we also use custom components from the TransformerEngine library. The TransformerEngine is a library that provides a set of pre-built components for building transformer models, which are a type of neural network architecture that has been shown to be highly effective for natural language processing tasks.

By using these custom components, we are able to build highly optimized transformer models that can achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of natural language processing tasks.

In summary, our training codebase utilizes Pytorch for deep learning and FSDP for data parallelism, while also leveraging custom components from the TransformerEngine library to build highly optimized transformer models. We hope this explanation has been helpful, and please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions.

We have made several optimizations to increase the training speed of our models. For multi-head attention uses, we use the memory efficient implementation from the xformers library (80). We also save activations that are expensive to compute during training when necessary. We employ mixed precision training, utilizing FP8, BF16, and FP32 as needed based on accuracy requirements and kernel availability throughout our network.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the optimizations made to increase the training speed of our models.

Firstly, we use the memory efficient implementation from the xformers library for multi-head attention uses. This means that we are using a library that has been specifically designed to optimize the memory usage of our models, which in turn helps to speed up the training process.

Secondly, we save activations that are expensive to compute during training when necessary. This means that we are only computing the activations that are needed for the current training iteration, rather than computing all activations at once. This helps to reduce the computational load on our models, which again helps to speed up the training process.

Finally, we employ mixed precision training, utilizing FP8, BF16, and FP32 as needed based on accuracy requirements and kernel availability throughout our network. This means that we are using a combination of different precision levels for our models, depending on the specific requirements of each layer. This helps to optimize the performance of our models, while also ensuring that we are using the most efficient precision level for each layer.

Overall, these optimizations have helped us to significantly increase the training speed of our models, while also ensuring that we are using the most efficient and accurate techniques available. We hope that this explanation has been helpful, and please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or comments. Thank you for watching!###

Scaling ESM3 to 98 billion parameters with its novel architecture, multi-modal inputs, and low precision computation requirements poses significant training stability challenges. Our model is significantly deeper than its NLP counterparts, and literature has shown that deeper networks are harder to train due to attention collapse (81).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the challenges of scaling ESM3 to 98 billion parameters. ESM3 is a language model that uses a novel architecture, multi-modal inputs, and low precision computation requirements. However, scaling this model to such a large size poses significant training stability challenges.

Firstly, let's define some terms. A parameter in machine learning refers to a variable that the model can adjust during training to improve its performance. In the case of ESM3, there are 98 billion parameters that need to be optimized during training.

The architecture of a model refers to its design and structure. ESM3 has a novel architecture, which means it has a unique design that sets it apart from other language models.

Multi-modal inputs refer to the ability of the model to process different types of data, such as text, images, and audio. This is an important feature of ESM3, as it allows the model to understand language in a more comprehensive way.

Low precision computation requirements refer to the fact that ESM3 can be trained using lower precision numbers, which reduces the amount of memory and computational resources required.

Now, let's discuss the challenges of scaling ESM3. As the model becomes deeper, meaning it has more layers, it becomes harder to train due to a phenomenon known as attention collapse. This occurs when the model becomes too focused on a small part of the input, ignoring the rest of the information. This can lead to poor performance and instability during training.

In summary, scaling ESM3 to 98 billion parameters with its novel architecture, multi-modal inputs, and low precision computation requirements poses significant training stability challenges due to attention collapse. It is important to address these challenges in order to improve the performance and stability of the model during training.
==============================
We observed training instability early in the architectural innovation phase, which we addressed through several changes. We apply layer normalization to the query and key vectors within the attention mechanism (82). We observe longer warm up helps (83). Another source of instability is the masking rate in pre-training tasks. We found that a very high masking rate is more likely to cause training divergences than a lower one, especially early in the training. Choosing a masking schedule biased towards lower mask rates improved both performance and training stability. Interestingly, the introduction of conditioning from other modalities also improves training stability, perhaps suggesting that stability is related to the degree of underspecification of a task.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the topic of training instability in the field of architectural innovation.

Firstly, let's define what we mean by training instability. This refers to the situation where the training process of a model becomes unstable, meaning that the model's performance does not improve or even deteriorates during training.

In our case, we observed training instability early in the architectural innovation phase. To address this issue, we applied several changes to our model.

One of the changes we made was to apply layer normalization to the query and key vectors within the attention mechanism. This technique helps to stabilize the training process by normalizing the input to each layer, which can prevent the model from becoming too sensitive to small changes in the input.

Another change we made was to increase the warm-up period. This refers to the initial phase of training where the learning rate is gradually increased from a small value to the final value. By increasing the warm-up period, we allow the model to adjust to the new learning rate more gradually, which can help to stabilize the training process.

We also found that the masking rate in pre-training tasks can be a source of instability. The masking rate refers to the percentage of tokens in the input that are randomly masked out during training. We found that a very high masking rate is more likely to cause training divergences than a lower one, especially early in the training. To address this issue, we chose a masking schedule that is biased towards lower mask rates, which improved both performance and training stability.

Finally, we found that introducing conditioning from other modalities can also improve training stability. This means that by providing additional information from other sources, such as images or audio, we can reduce the degree of underspecification of the task, which can help to stabilize the training process.

In conclusion, training instability can be a common issue in the field of architectural innovation, but by applying techniques such as layer normalization, increasing the warm-up period, choosing a lower masking rate, and introducing conditioning from other modalities, we can improve the stability of the training process and achieve better performance.

An incorrectly set learning rate is another source of instability. To ensure the right balance between learning effectiveness and stability, we optimized the learning rate on smaller models and scaled it according to best practices as outlined in $(84,85)$. We find empirically that the initialization has a small effect on model stability, and the majority of stabilization can be gained from simply scaling the learning rate at the appropriate rate. By applying the rules in both width $-\mu \mathrm{P}$ and depth $-\mu \mathrm{P}$, we can simply scale the learning rate inversely proportional to the square root of the number of parameters, and find this results in stable training.

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of learning rate in the field of machine learning. Learning rate is a hyperparameter that determines the step size at which the model is updated during training. It is a crucial parameter that affects the stability and effectiveness of the model.

Following these modifications, we successfully trained our 98-billion-parameter model without any issues related to training instability.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the recent success in training a 98-billion-parameter model without any issues related to training instability.

First, let's define what we mean by a "parameter" in the context of machine learning. A parameter is a variable that is used to define the behavior of a model. In this case, a 98-billion-parameter model refers to a model with 98 billion variables that are used to define its behavior.

Now, let's talk about training instability. Training instability occurs when a model is unable to converge during the training process. This can happen when the model is too complex or when the data being used to train the model is noisy or inconsistent.

To address this issue, the researchers made some modifications to the training process. Unfortunately, the specific modifications were not mentioned in the original statement. However, it is likely that they used techniques such as regularization or early stopping to prevent overfitting and improve the stability of the training process.

Overall, this is an exciting development in the field of machine learning as it demonstrates the potential for even larger and more complex models to be trained successfully. Thank you for watching and we hope this explanation was helpful!###

We stage training to alter dataset composition, train on longer contexts that would be too expensive for the entire pre-training, or introduce features such as the taxonomy track (A.1.9.2.

------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference to experts in the field of machine learning. Specifically, we will be looking at the concept of staging training to alter dataset composition, train on longer contexts that would be too expensive for the entire pre-training, or introduce features such as the taxonomy track.

Let's start by breaking down each of these terms.

Dataset composition refers to the makeup of the data that is used to train a machine learning model. This can include the number of samples, the distribution of classes, and the types of features that are present.

Pre-training is the process of training a machine learning model on a large dataset before fine-tuning it on a smaller dataset for a specific task. This is often done to improve the performance of the model on the smaller dataset.

Context refers to the length of the input sequence that is used to make predictions. Longer contexts can provide more information to the model, but can also be more computationally expensive.

The taxonomy track is a specific feature that can be introduced during training. It involves grouping similar classes together in a hierarchical structure, which can help the model better understand the relationships between different classes.

So, when we talk about staging training to alter dataset composition, train on longer contexts that would be too expensive for the entire pre-training, or introduce features such as the taxonomy track, we are referring to specific techniques that can be used to improve the performance of machine learning models.

By altering the dataset composition, we can ensure that the model is exposed to a diverse range of data, which can help it generalize better to new data. By training on longer contexts, we can provide the model with more information, which can improve its accuracy. And by introducing features such as the taxonomy track, we can help the model better understand the relationships between different classes, which can also improve its performance.

Overall, these techniques are important for anyone working in the field of machine learning, as they can help improve the accuracy and efficiency of models. Thank you for watching, and we hope this explanation has been helpful!###
