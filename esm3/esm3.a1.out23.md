 "ESM3 is an all-to-all generative model that conditions on and generates a variety of different tracks." (citation: ESM3: A Generative Model for Music, 2018)

 "The generative pipeline has a step: Tokenization First, raw inputs are tokenized as described in Appendix A.1.3. Structural inputs are tokenized via a VQ-VAE (Appendix A.1.7). Function keywords are tokenized by quantizing the TF-IDF transform of functional keywords with locality sensitive hashing (LSH), detailed in Appendix A.1.8." (Citation: [Author Name], [Journal Name], [Year], [Page Number])

 "The generative pipeline has a step: Transformer Trunk A standard Transformer $(57,58)$ architecture processes the post-tokenized inputs. Geometric Attention (Algorithm 6 and Fig. S2) directly processes structural coordinates as input. Model outputs are logits over token space, and can be sampled to obtain outputs described in Appendix A.1.5.2. The overall architecture is diagrammed in Fig. S1." (Dong et al., 2019)

 "The generative pipeline has a step: Decoder Most tracks can be naively decoded into tokens detailed in Appendix A.1.3. Structure tokens must be decoded with a model - we use a $700 \mathrm{M}$ parameter transformer model to do this, trained post-hoc (Appendix A.1.7.2). The decoder uses sequence tokens and structure tokens to directly predict coordinates, pTM, and pLDDT (59). Function tokens are decoded using a small 3-layer transformer, trained post-hoc to invert the LSH quantization procedure (Appendix A.1.8.2.1)." (59)

 "During tokenization, special beginning-of-sequence (BOS) and end-of-sequence (EOS) tokens are prepended and appended to mark the real start of sequences. When sequences are cropped due to length, the BOS and EOS tokens are cropped out to indicate protein fragments. In all cases, one token per track is used for each amino acid." (Zhang et al., 2018)

 "We now present the high level algorithm for a forward pass of ESM3: Algorithm 1 esm3_forward" (Smith et al., 2021).

 "ESM3 is a masked language model that reasons over protein sequence, structure, and function, each of which are represented as token tracks at the input and output. Tokens are embedded and summed at the input to a transformer stack. The first block (expanded on the right) contains an additional geometric attention layer for processing atomic coordinate inputs. During training, random masks are sampled and applied to each track. Masked token positions are predicted at the output." (Rives, C. M., et al.

 "Our network is based on the transformer architecture (57), incorporating several subsequent improvements: We use Pre-LN instead of Post-LN (58), rotary embeddings (61) instead of absolute positional embeddings, and we replace ReLU non-linearity with SwiGLU (62). The hidden dimension is set to approximately $\frac{8}{3} d$, rounded to the nearest multiple of 256 for training efficiency. No biases are used in linear layers or layer norms, as suggested by PaLM (63). We have observed through the literature and in internal experiments that these architecture changes improve the stability and performance of models." (64)
