The generative pipeline has a step:
Decoder Most tracks can be naively decoded into tokens detailed in Appendix A.1.3. Structure tokens must be decoded with a model - we use a $700 \mathrm{M}$ parameter transformer model to do this, trained post-hoc (Appendix A.1.7.2). The decoder uses sequence tokens and structure tokens to directly predict coordinates, pTM, and pLDDT (59). Function tokens are decoded using a small 3-layer transformer, trained post-hoc to invert the LSH quantization procedure (Appendix A.1.8.2.1).

During tokenization, special beginning-of-sequence (BOS) and end-of-sequence (EOS) tokens are prepended and appended to mark the real start of sequences. When sequences are cropped due to length, the BOS and EOS tokens are cropped out to indicate protein fragments. In all cases, one token per track is used for each amino acid.

Figure S1. The ESM3 architecture. ESM3 is a masked language model that reasons over protein sequence, structure, and function, each of which are represented as token tracks at the input and output. Tokens are embedded and summed at the input to a transformer stack. The first block (expanded on the right) contains an additional geometric attention layer for processing atomic coordinate inputs. During training, random masks are sampled and applied to each track. Masked token positions are predicted at the output.

Our network is based on the transformer architecture (57), incorporating several subsequent improvements: We use Pre-LN instead of Post-LN (58), rotary embeddings (61) instead of absolute positional embeddings, and we replace ReLU non-linearity with SwiGLU (62). The hidden dimension is set to approximately $\frac{8}{3} d$, rounded to the nearest multiple of 256 for training efficiency. No biases are used in linear layers or layer norms, as suggested by PaLM (63). We have observed through the literature and in internal experiments that these architecture changes improve the stability and performance of models.

ESM3-small (1.4B) is a 48-layer network, while ESM3medium (7B) has 96 layers, and ESM3-large (98B) has 216 layers.

Prior work also demonstrates that modalities like ours benefit more from deeper networks $(64,65)$. Detailed network specifications can be found in Table S1.

 I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I do not have access to a comprehensive database of scientific papers. However, I can suggest using search engines such as Google Scholar or PubMed to find relevant papers. You can try searching for keywords related to the sentence you provided, such as "Geometric Attention" and "structure coordinates". Once you find relevant papers, you can use citation management tools such as Mendeley or Zotero to generate citations in the desired format.
==============================
For keyword-based function tokens, each of the eight integers per residue is converted to a "sub-embedding" (Appendix A.1.5.1 line 5), then concatenated to form the perresidue embedding (Appendix A.1.5.1 line 6). For InterPro residue annotations, the inputs are multi-hot. To create an embedding vector, we sum the embeddings for each of the "on" features (equivalent to the matrix-multiply on Appendix A.1.5.1 line 7).

Geometric attention enables high-throughput encoding of protein structures. Protein backbone structure can be represented by the relative distance and orientation of frames defined by each residue's backbone coordinates. Reasoning over the relative orientation of frames is important to capture the local backbone geometry when only partial structure is provided. Geometric attention is an $S E(3)$ invariant allto-all attention mechanism which reasons over the relative distances and orientations of all defined frames in the input (Fig. S2). Because this attention operation can be realized using the same computational primitives as attention, it is readily scalable.

Frames are representations that encapsulate the 3D positional and rotational information of residue backbones and sidechains in a protein structure. We use a formulation similar to Ingraham et al. (66). Each frame $T \in S E(3)$ consists of a rotation matrix $\mathbf{R} \in S O(3)$ and a translation vector $\mathbf{t} \in \mathbb{R}^{3}$

Rotation Matrix: The rotation matrix $\mathbf{R}_{i}$ for residue $i$ is composed of three 3-dimensional vectors $\left[\hat{x}, \hat{e}_{1}, \hat{e}_{2}\right]$ :
1. $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{e}_{1}$ are orthogonal unit vectors on the $N-$ $C_{\alpha}-C$ plane.
2. $\hat{e}_{2}$ is a unit vector perpendicular to both $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{e}_{1}$.

Figure S2. Geometric attention. Geometric attention is an $\mathrm{SE}(3)$ invariant all-to-all attention mechanism where the attention score matrix is a weighted sum of two terms: (1) the pairwise distances between queries and keys rotated and translated by their respective backbone frames, and (2) the pairwise dot products between queries and keys rotated by their respective backbone frames. This attention mechanism encodes structural information with throughput comparable to the standard attention operation in transformers.
