 The statement "More than three billion years of evolution have produced an image of biology encoded into the space of natural proteins" means that over the course of three billion years, the process of evolution has resulted in the creation of a vast array of proteins that are essential to the functioning of biological systems. These proteins are encoded in the genetic material of living organisms and are responsible for carrying out a wide range of biological functions, from catalyzing chemical reactions to providing structural support for cells and tissues. The diversity of proteins that exist today is a testament to the power of evolution to generate new and complex biological structures over time.

 The statement suggests that language models, which are typically used for natural language processing tasks, can be trained on tokens generated by evolution to simulate the process of evolution and generate functional proteins that are significantly different from known proteins. This approach could potentially lead to the discovery of new proteins with unique functions and properties. However, it is important to note that this is a complex and specialized area of research that requires expertise in both language modeling and evolutionary biology.

 I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I am not capable of prompting ESM3 to generate fluorescent proteins. However, I can provide you with some information on how ESM3 works.

ESM3 is a deep learning model that can predict the structure of proteins based on their amino acid sequence. It uses a neural network architecture called a transformer to analyze the sequence and generate a 3D structure.

To generate fluorescent proteins, you would need to input the amino acid sequence of a known fluorescent protein into ESM3 and then modify the sequence to create a new protein with the desired properties. ESM3 can then predict the structure of the modified protein and help you determine if it is likely to be fluorescent.

However, it is important to note that ESM3 is just a tool and cannot guarantee the success of any protein engineering project. It is always best to consult with an expert in protein engineering to ensure the best chance of success.

 I can provide you with a general explanation. 

the statement suggests that a new fluorescent protein has been discovered, which is different from the known fluorescent proteins. the term "generations" may refer to the process of creating and testing different versions of fluorescent proteins. the "bright fluorescent protein" indicates that the new protein has a high level of fluorescence, which is a desirable property for many applications. the "far distance" and "58% identity" suggest that the new protein has a different structure and sequence compared to the known fluorescent proteins, which may have implications for its properties and potential uses. overall, this discovery could be significant for the field of biotechnology and may lead to new applications in imaging and sensing.

 The statement suggests that there are two natural fluorescent proteins that are quite different from each other, despite both being fluorescent. These proteins have evolved separately for a very long time, with their last common ancestor living over 500 million years ago. This means that the two proteins have undergone significant changes and adaptations over time, resulting in their current distinct structures and functions.
