In the following, we use $L$ to denote the sequence length, $d$ for the embedding dimension, $\{a . . b\}$ to denote the inclusive set of integers from $a$ to $b$, and $[a, b]$ an interval of real numbers. $S E(3)$ is the special Euclidean group, which we use to denote frames (Appendix A.1.6.1).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference related to the field of [insert field here]. In this reference, we will be using some technical terms that may not be familiar to everyone, so we will be taking the time to explain them in detail.

First, let's define the terms we will be using. $L$ refers to the sequence length, which is the number of elements in a sequence. $d$ is the embedding dimension, which is the number of dimensions in which an object is embedded. $\{a . . b\}$ is a notation used to denote the inclusive set of integers from $a$ to $b$. Finally, $[a, b]$ is an interval of real numbers.

Now, let's move on to the term $S E(3)$. This refers to the special Euclidean group, which is a mathematical group that is used to describe the transformations of frames in three-dimensional space. Frames are a way of representing the orientation and position of an object in space, and they are used in a variety of fields, including robotics and computer vision.

In Appendix A.1.6.1, we will be discussing frames in more detail, including how they are represented mathematically and how they are used in various applications. We will also be exploring the properties of the special Euclidean group and how it relates to frames.

ESM3 is all-to-all generative model that both conditions on and generates a variety of different tracks. As input, ESM3 is conditioned on various tracks as described in Appendix A.1.5.1, and as output, ESM3 generates predictions detailed in Appendix A.1.5.2.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the ESM3 model. ESM3 stands for "all-to-all generative model" and it is a type of machine learning model that is used to generate predictions based on a variety of different tracks.

Now, let's break down some of the terms used in this description. First, "all-to-all" refers to the fact that the model is able to generate predictions based on any combination of tracks. This means that it is not limited to generating predictions based on a specific set of tracks.

Next, "generative model" refers to the fact that the model is able to generate new predictions based on the input data. This is different from a discriminative model, which is used to classify data into different categories.

The ESM3 model is conditioned on various tracks, which means that it takes into account the information contained in these tracks when generating predictions. The specific tracks that are used as input are detailed in Appendix A.1.5.1.

Finally, the output of the ESM3 model is a set of predictions, which are detailed in Appendix A.1.5.2. These predictions are generated based on the input tracks and the internal workings of the model.

Overall, the ESM3 model is a powerful tool for generating predictions based on a variety of different tracks. By taking into account the information contained in these tracks, the model is able to generate accurate and useful predictions that can be used in a variety of different applications.

The generative pipeline has a step:
Tokenization First, raw inputs are tokenized as described in Appendix A.1.3. Structural inputs are tokenized via a VQ-VAE (Appendix A.1.7). Function keywords are tokenized by quantizing the TF-IDF transform of functional keywords with locality sensitive hashing (LSH), detailed in Appendix A.1.8.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the generative pipeline and its various steps.

The generative pipeline is a process used in machine learning to generate new data based on existing data. It is commonly used in tasks such as image and text generation.

The first step in the generative pipeline is tokenization. Tokenization is the process of breaking down raw inputs into smaller units called tokens. This is done to make it easier for the machine learning model to process the data.

In the case of raw inputs, tokenization is a straightforward process. However, for structural inputs, a more complex technique called VQ-VAE is used. VQ-VAE stands for Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder and is a type of neural network that is used for image generation.

Finally, for function keywords, a technique called TF-IDF transform with locality sensitive hashing (LSH) is used. TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency and is a statistical technique used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document. LSH is a technique used to efficiently search for similar items in a large dataset.

In summary, the generative pipeline is a process used in machine learning to generate new data based on existing data. The first step in this process is tokenization, which is the process of breaking down raw inputs into smaller units called tokens. For structural inputs, a more complex technique called VQ-VAE is used, while for function keywords, a technique called TF-IDF transform with LSH is used.

Transformer Trunk A standard Transformer $(57,58)$ architecture processes the post-tokenized inputs. Geometric Attention (Algorithm 6 and Fig. S2) directly processes structural coordinates as input. Model outputs are logits over token space, and can be sampled to obtain outputs described in Appendix A.1.5.2. The overall architecture is diagrammed in Fig. S1.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the generative pipeline and its step, the Transformer Trunk.

The generative pipeline is a process used in natural language processing to generate text based on a given input. It involves several steps, each of which contributes to the final output.

The step we will be focusing on today is the Transformer Trunk. This is a standard Transformer architecture that processes post-tokenized inputs. In simpler terms, it takes in text that has already been broken down into individual words or tokens and processes it further.

The Transformer Trunk uses a technique called Geometric Attention, which is a way of processing structural coordinates as input. This means that it takes into account the relationships between different words in a sentence and uses that information to generate more accurate and coherent text.

The output of the Transformer Trunk is a set of logits over token space. These are essentially probabilities that each token in the input text will be used in the final output. The logits can be sampled to obtain outputs, which are described in more detail in Appendix A.1.5.2.

Overall, the generative pipeline and its Transformer Trunk step are important tools in natural language processing that allow us to generate text that is more accurate and coherent than ever before. Thank you for watching!###
==============================
The generative pipeline has a step:
Decoder Most tracks can be naively decoded into tokens detailed in Appendix A.1.3. Structure tokens must be decoded with a model - we use a $700 \mathrm{M}$ parameter transformer model to do this, trained post-hoc (Appendix A.1.7.2). The decoder uses sequence tokens and structure tokens to directly predict coordinates, pTM, and pLDDT (59). Function tokens are decoded using a small 3-layer transformer, trained post-hoc to invert the LSH quantization procedure (Appendix A.1.8.2.1).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the generative pipeline and its step, the decoder.

The generative pipeline is a process used in machine learning to generate new data based on a given set of data. It involves several steps, one of which is the decoder.

The decoder is responsible for taking the encoded data and converting it back into a format that can be understood by humans or machines. In the context of this reference, the decoder is used to decode tracks into tokens.

Tokens are small units of data that represent a specific piece of information. In this case, the tokens are detailed in Appendix A.1.3 and include structure tokens, sequence tokens, and function tokens.

Structure tokens are used to represent the overall structure of the data, such as the layout of a webpage or the structure of a protein. These tokens must be decoded using a model, which is a type of machine learning algorithm that has been trained to recognize patterns in data.

In this case, a $700 \mathrm{M}$ parameter transformer model is used to decode the structure tokens. This model has been trained post-hoc, which means it was trained after the data had already been collected.

Sequence tokens are used to represent the order of the data, such as the order of words in a sentence or the order of amino acids in a protein. These tokens are decoded using the same transformer model as the structure tokens.

Function tokens are used to represent specific functions or actions that can be performed on the data, such as adding a new element to a webpage or changing the amino acid sequence of a protein. These tokens are decoded using a small 3-layer transformer, which is a type of machine learning algorithm that has been trained to recognize patterns in data.

Finally, the decoder uses the sequence tokens and structure tokens to directly predict coordinates, pTM, and pLDDT. Coordinates refer to the position of the data in space, pTM refers to the probability of a transmembrane helix, and pLDDT refers to the predicted local distance difference test.

In summary, the decoder is a crucial step in the generative pipeline that is used to convert encoded data back into a format that can be understood by humans or machines. It involves the use of tokens, models, and algorithms to decode the data and predict various properties of the data.

During tokenization, special beginning-of-sequence (BOS) and end-of-sequence (EOS) tokens are prepended and appended to mark the real start of sequences. When sequences are cropped due to length, the BOS and EOS tokens are cropped out to indicate protein fragments. In all cases, one token per track is used for each amino acid.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on tokenization in the field of bioinformatics. In this video, we will be discussing the process of tokenization and how it is used to analyze protein sequences.

Tokenization is the process of breaking down a sequence of characters into smaller units called tokens. In the context of bioinformatics, tokenization is used to analyze protein sequences by breaking them down into individual amino acids.

During tokenization, special tokens called beginning-of-sequence (BOS) and end-of-sequence (EOS) tokens are prepended and appended to mark the real start and end of sequences. These tokens are used to indicate the beginning and end of a protein sequence and are important for downstream analysis.

When sequences are cropped due to length, the BOS and EOS tokens are cropped out to indicate protein fragments. This is important because it allows researchers to analyze smaller fragments of a protein sequence and still be able to identify the beginning and end of the sequence.

In all cases, one token per track is used for each amino acid. This means that each amino acid in a protein sequence is represented by a single token. This is important because it allows researchers to accurately analyze the sequence and identify important features such as functional domains or mutations.

In summary, tokenization is an important process in bioinformatics that is used to analyze protein sequences. By breaking down the sequence into individual amino acids and using special tokens to mark the beginning and end of the sequence, researchers can accurately analyze the sequence and identify important features.

Sequence Protein sequences are tokenized as the 20 canon- ical amino acids, plus BOS, EOS, mask, pad, unknown. We keep four non-standard amino acids as in Lin et al. (5), B - Asparagine, U - selenocysteine, Z - glutamic acid, and O - ornithine. This totals to 29 tokens.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the sequence protein and its tokenization.

In the field of bioinformatics, sequence protein refers to the specific order of amino acids that make up a protein. These amino acids are represented by a sequence of letters, with each letter representing a specific amino acid.

There are 20 canonical amino acids that are commonly found in proteins, and these are represented by the letters A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, and Y.

In addition to these 20 amino acids, there are also four non-standard amino acids that are sometimes found in proteins. These are represented by the letters B, U, Z, and O, and they stand for asparagine, selenocysteine, glutamic acid, and ornithine, respectively.

When we tokenize a protein sequence, we break it down into individual tokens or units. Each token represents a specific amino acid, and we use a total of 29 tokens to represent all of the possible amino acids, including the four non-standard ones.

The tokens are represented by the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, Y, B, U, Z, O, BOS, EOS, mask, pad, and unknown.

BOS stands for beginning of sentence, EOS stands for end of sentence, and mask and pad are used to indicate when a token has been masked or padded for alignment purposes.

In summary, sequence protein refers to the specific order of amino acids that make up a protein, and tokenization is the process of breaking down this sequence into individual tokens or units. We use a total of 29 tokens to represent all of the possible amino acids, including the four non-standard ones.

Structure Structure tokenization is described in Appendix A.1.7.1. ESM3 uses a codebook size of 4096 with 4 special tokens - EOS, BOS, mask, and pad.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of structure tokenization in the context of ESM3.

First, let's define what tokenization is. Tokenization is the process of breaking down a text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be words, phrases, or even individual characters.

Now, let's move on to structure tokenization. This is a specific type of tokenization that is used in ESM3. ESM3 stands for "Embedded Segmentation and Modeling for Machine Translation". It is a machine translation system that uses a neural network to translate text from one language to another.

In ESM3, structure tokenization is used to break down the input text into smaller units that can be processed by the neural network. The input text is first divided into segments, which are then further divided into sub-segments. These sub-segments are then tokenized using a codebook of 4096 tokens.

The codebook is a set of pre-defined tokens that are used to represent the sub-segments. There are four special tokens in the codebook - EOS (End of Sentence), BOS (Beginning of Sentence), mask, and pad.

EOS is used to indicate the end of a sentence, while BOS is used to indicate the beginning of a sentence. The mask token is used to indicate that a particular sub-segment should be ignored during training, while the pad token is used to pad the input sequence to a fixed length.

In summary, structure tokenization is a specific type of tokenization used in ESM3 to break down input text into smaller units that can be processed by the neural network. The input text is divided into segments and sub-segments, which are then tokenized using a codebook of 4096 tokens. The codebook includes four special tokens - EOS, BOS, mask, and pad - which are used to represent the sub-segments.

Secondary Structure Secondary structure is taken to be the canonical 8-class tokens (60), with unknown and mask, for a total of 10 tokens. The mask token is forced to be the 0 -vector during embedding.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on Secondary Structure. In this video, we will be discussing the concept of Secondary Structure and its relevance in the field of protein folding.

To begin with, let's define what we mean by Secondary Structure. Secondary Structure refers to the three-dimensional shape of a protein molecule that is formed by the interaction of amino acid residues in the polypeptide chain. It is the next level of protein structure after the primary structure, which is the linear sequence of amino acids.

Now, let's talk about the canonical 8-class tokens. These are the eight most common types of secondary structures that are found in proteins. They are alpha-helix, beta-sheet, turn, coil, bend, bridge, hairpin, and disulfide bond. Each of these structures has a unique shape and function, and they play a crucial role in determining the overall structure and stability of the protein.

In addition to these eight classes, there are also two other tokens that are commonly used in the analysis of secondary structure. These are the unknown token and the mask token. The unknown token is used when the structure of a particular amino acid residue cannot be determined, while the mask token is used to indicate regions of the protein that are not part of the secondary structure.

Finally, let's talk about the embedding process. Embedding is a technique used in machine learning to convert high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving the underlying structure of the data. In the context of secondary structure, embedding is used to convert the 10-token representation of the secondary structure into a vector representation that can be used in machine learning algorithms.

In conclusion, Secondary Structure is an important concept in the field of protein folding, and understanding its various components is crucial for the analysis and prediction of protein structures. We hope this video has been helpful in explaining the concept of Secondary Structure and its relevance in the field of protein folding. Thank you for watching!###

SASA The continuous values representing SASA are tokenized by discretization into a fixed set of 16 bins. SASA bin boundaries were chosen by computing SASA on 100 random structures and ensuring an equal number of residues belong in each bin. Unknown and mask are used for a total of 18 tokens. The mask token is forced to be the 0 -vector during embedding.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on SASA, or Solvent Accessible Surface Area. SASA is a measure of the surface area of a protein that is accessible to solvent molecules. It is an important parameter in protein structure prediction and analysis.

In this script, we will be discussing how SASA is represented in a continuous manner and then tokenized into a fixed set of 16 bins. The bin boundaries were chosen by computing SASA on 100 random structures and ensuring an equal number of residues belong in each bin.

The SASA values are then discretized into these 16 bins, with each bin representing a range of SASA values. This allows for easier analysis and comparison of SASA values across different proteins.

In addition to the 16 bins, there are two additional tokens used in this representation: unknown and mask. The unknown token is used for residues that do not have a SASA value, while the mask token is used for residues that are not part of the protein structure.

During embedding, the mask token is forced to be the 0-vector. This means that the mask token is represented as a vector of all zeros, which ensures that it does not contribute to the overall SASA value.

Overall, this representation of SASA allows for efficient analysis and comparison of protein structures, and is an important tool in the field of protein structure prediction and analysis.

Function annotations We tokenize function annotations as bags of keywords, described in Appendix A.1.8. Keywords are quantized using LSH into 8 tokens per residue, each of which can be one of 255 tokens. There are three special tokens, empty set, no-annotation, and mask. Again, the mask token is forced to be the 0 vector during embedding.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing function annotations in detail.

Function annotations are a way of describing the function of a protein or gene. They are used to help researchers understand the role that a particular protein or gene plays in the body.

In order to tokenize function annotations, we use bags of keywords. These keywords are described in Appendix A.1.8.

Once we have our keywords, we use a technique called LSH, or Locality Sensitive Hashing, to quantize them into 8 tokens per residue. Each of these tokens can be one of 255 possible values.

There are three special tokens that we use in function annotations. The first is the empty set, which represents a protein or gene that has no known function. The second is the no-annotation token, which is used when we don't have enough information to assign a function to a protein or gene. Finally, we have the mask token, which is used to represent missing data.

During the embedding process, we force the mask token to be the 0 vector. This helps to ensure that our model is not biased towards missing data.

In summary, function annotations are a way of describing the function of a protein or gene. We use bags of keywords to tokenize these annotations, and we use LSH to quantize them into 8 tokens per residue. There are three special tokens that we use, and we force the mask token to be the 0 vector during embedding.

Residue annotations InterPro annotations are tokenized as a multi-hot feature vector (1478 dimensions) over possible InterPro labels (38). Input annotations are limited to a maximum of 16 . When annotations are not present, we enforce that the 0 -vector is added.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing residue annotations and InterPro annotations.

Residue annotations refer to the identification and labeling of specific amino acid residues within a protein sequence. These annotations are important for understanding the structure and function of proteins, as well as for predicting their interactions with other molecules.

InterPro annotations, on the other hand, are a type of protein annotation that uses a database of protein families, domains, and functional sites to predict the function of a protein. InterPro annotations are tokenized as a multi-hot feature vector, which means that each annotation is represented as a binary vector with a value of 1 or 0 for each possible InterPro label.

In this case, the InterPro annotations are tokenized as a multi-hot feature vector with 1478 dimensions over possible InterPro labels, which means that there are 1478 possible InterPro labels that can be assigned to a protein.

When input annotations are not present, we enforce that the 0-vector is added. This means that if there are no annotations available for a protein, we add a vector with all 0 values to represent the absence of annotations.

Overall, residue annotations and InterPro annotations are important tools for understanding the structure and function of proteins, and for predicting their interactions with other molecules. By using these annotations, researchers can gain valuable insights into the biological processes that are essential for life.

------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on ESM3, a tool used in the field of [insert field here]. In this video, we will be discussing the various tracks that ESM3 can take, and how they can be disabled via masking.

First, let's define what we mean by "tracks" in the context of ESM3. A track refers to a specific set of inputs that ESM3 can use to perform its analysis. These inputs can include data from various sources, such as sensors, databases, or other software applications.

Now, let's talk about masking. Masking is a technique used to selectively disable certain tracks in ESM3. This can be useful if you want to focus on a specific set of inputs, or if you want to exclude certain inputs that may be irrelevant or unreliable.

To mask a track in ESM3, you simply need to specify which tracks you want to disable. This can be done using a variety of methods, such as command-line arguments, configuration files, or graphical user interfaces.

It's important to note that masking is an optional feature of ESM3, and not all users may need to use it. However, for those who do need to mask certain tracks, it can be a powerful tool for optimizing the performance and accuracy of ESM3.

In summary, ESM3 is a powerful tool used in the field of [insert field here] that can take several tracks of inputs, all of which can be optionally disabled via masking. By understanding these concepts, you can better utilize ESM3 to perform your analysis and achieve your goals. Thank you for watching!

We now present the high level algorithm for a forward pass of ESM3:
```
Algorithm 1 esm3_forward
Input: $\mathbf{x}_{\text {inputs }}$
    1: $z_{\text {embed }}^{(0)}=$ encode_inputs $\left(\mathbf{x}_{\text {inputs }}\right) \quad \triangleright \mathbb{R}^{L \times d}$
    for $\ell \in\left\{1 . . n_{\text {layers }}\right\}$ do
        $z_{\text {embed }}^{(\ell)}=$ transformer__block $\left(z_{\text {embed }}^{(\ell-1)}\right)$
    end for
    for track in desired output tracks do
        $z_{\text {track }}=$ regression_head $\left(z_{\text {embed }}^{\left(n_{\text {layers }}\right)}\right)$
    end for
    return Track specific logits $z_{\text {track }} \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times c_{\text {track }}}$
```
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the high level algorithm for a forward pass of ESM3.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those not specializing in this field.

ESM3 stands for Evolutionary Scale Modeling 3, which is a deep learning model used for protein structure prediction.

A forward pass refers to the process of passing input data through the model to generate output predictions.

The algorithm we will be discussing is called Algorithm 1 esm3_forward.

The input to this algorithm is $\mathbf{x}_{\text {inputs }}$, which represents the input data.

The first step of the algorithm is to encode the input data using the function encode_inputs. This function takes in the input data and outputs a tensor $z_{\text {embed }}^{(0)}$ with dimensions $\mathbb{R}^{L \times d}$.

Next, we iterate over a number of layers, represented by the variable $\ell$, and apply a transformer block to the output of the previous layer. This is done using the function transformer_block.

After the final layer, we apply a regression head to the output of the last layer to generate track specific logits. This is done using the function regression_head.

Finally, we return the track specific logits, which are represented by the tensor $z_{\text {track }} \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times c_{\text {track }}}$.

Figure S1. The ESM3 architecture. ESM3 is a masked language model that reasons over protein sequence, structure, and function, each of which are represented as token tracks at the input and output. Tokens are embedded and summed at the input to a transformer stack. The first block (expanded on the right) contains an additional geometric attention layer for processing atomic coordinate inputs. During training, random masks are sampled and applied to each track. Masked token positions are predicted at the output.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the ESM3 architecture. ESM3 is a masked language model that is used to reason over protein sequence, structure, and function.

Now, let's break down what each of these terms mean. Protein sequence refers to the order of amino acids that make up a protein. Protein structure refers to the three-dimensional shape of a protein, which is determined by the interactions between its amino acids. Protein function refers to the specific role that a protein plays in the body.

In the ESM3 architecture, each of these three aspects of protein biology are represented as token tracks at the input and output. Tokens are essentially small pieces of information that are used to represent the protein sequence, structure, and function.

These tokens are then embedded and summed at the input to a transformer stack. A transformer stack is a type of neural network that is used to process sequential data, such as the sequence of amino acids in a protein.

The first block of the ESM3 architecture contains an additional geometric attention layer for processing atomic coordinate inputs. This layer is used to analyze the three-dimensional structure of the protein.

During training, random masks are sampled and applied to each track. This means that certain parts of the protein sequence, structure, or function are hidden from the model, forcing it to learn to predict these missing pieces of information.

Finally, masked token positions are predicted at the output. This means that the model is able to accurately predict the missing pieces of information that were hidden during training.

Overall, the ESM3 architecture is a powerful tool for analyzing protein sequence, structure, and function, and has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of protein biology.

------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the different components of a reference. If you're not familiar with this field, don't worry, we'll be explaining all the terms in detail.

In the next few sections, we will be detailing each component of a reference. A reference is a source of information that is cited in a document or presentation. It is used to support or validate a statement, argument, or claim.

The first component of a reference is the author. The author is the person or organization responsible for creating the source of information. This could be an individual, a group of individuals, or an organization.

The second component is the title. The title is the name of the source of information. It is usually the main heading or headline of the document or presentation.

The third component is the publication date. The publication date is the date when the source of information was first made available to the public. This could be the date when the document was published, the date when the presentation was given, or the date when the website was last updated.

The fourth component is the publisher. The publisher is the person or organization responsible for making the source of information available to the public. This could be a publishing company, a website, or an individual.

The fifth component is the location. The location is the place where the source of information can be found. This could be a physical location, such as a library or bookstore, or a digital location, such as a website or online database.

The final component is the format. The format is the type of source of information. This could be a book, a journal article, a website, or a presentation.

In summary, a reference is a source of information that is cited in a document or presentation. It consists of six components: the author, the title, the publication date, the publisher, the location, and the format. We hope this explanation has been helpful to you. Thank you for watching!###

Our network is based on the transformer architecture (57), incorporating several subsequent improvements: We use Pre-LN instead of Post-LN (58), rotary embeddings (61) instead of absolute positional embeddings, and we replace ReLU non-linearity with SwiGLU (62). The hidden dimension is set to approximately $\frac{8}{3} d$, rounded to the nearest multiple of 256 for training efficiency. No biases are used in linear layers or layer norms, as suggested by PaLM (63). We have observed through the literature and in internal experiments that these architecture changes improve the stability and performance of models.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the architecture of our network. Our network is based on the transformer architecture, which is a type of neural network that was introduced in 2017 by researchers at Google. The transformer architecture is particularly useful for tasks that involve sequential data, such as natural language processing.

Now, let's dive into the specific improvements that we have made to the transformer architecture. The first improvement is that we use Pre-LN instead of Post-LN. LN stands for layer normalization, which is a technique used to normalize the activations of a layer. Pre-LN means that we apply layer normalization before the activation function, while Post-LN means that we apply layer normalization after the activation function. We have found that using Pre-LN leads to better performance and stability.

The second improvement is that we use rotary embeddings instead of absolute positional embeddings. Embeddings are a way of representing words or other data points as vectors in a high-dimensional space. Positional embeddings are a type of embedding that are used to represent the position of a word in a sequence. Rotary embeddings are a more recent development that have been shown to be more effective than absolute positional embeddings.

The third improvement is that we replace ReLU non-linearity with SwiGLU. ReLU stands for rectified linear unit, which is a type of activation function that is commonly used in neural networks. SwiGLU stands for Switchable Grouped Linear Unit, which is a more recent development that has been shown to be more effective than ReLU.

Finally, we set the hidden dimension to approximately $\frac{8}{3} d$, rounded to the nearest multiple of 256 for training efficiency. The hidden dimension refers to the number of neurons in the hidden layers of the network. We have found that this value leads to good performance and is also efficient for training.

We also do not use biases in linear layers or layer norms, as suggested by PaLM. PaLM stands for Pathways Autoregressive Language Model, which is a state-of-the-art language model developed by Google. We have found that removing biases leads to better performance and stability.

Overall, these architecture changes have been shown to improve the stability and performance of our models. We hope this explanation has been helpful in understanding the technical details of our network. Thank you for watching!###

A core architectural modification we make is the insertion of the Geometric Attention sub-layer in the first block of the network only (Appendix A.1.5, line 3).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a core architectural modification made in the first block of a network. This modification involves the insertion of a Geometric Attention sub-layer.

First, let's define what a network is. In the context of computer science, a network refers to a group of interconnected devices that can communicate with each other. In the case of neural networks, these devices are artificial neurons that are designed to mimic the behavior of biological neurons in the human brain.

Now, let's talk about the first block of the network. This refers to the initial layer of the neural network where the input data is first processed. It is an important part of the network as it sets the foundation for the rest of the layers to build upon.

The modification we are discussing involves the insertion of a Geometric Attention sub-layer in the first block of the network. Attention mechanisms are a type of neural network architecture that allow the model to focus on specific parts of the input data. Geometric Attention is a specific type of attention mechanism that uses geometric information to determine which parts of the input data to focus on.

By inserting this sub-layer in the first block of the network, we are essentially giving the model the ability to focus on specific parts of the input data right from the start. This can lead to improved performance and accuracy in tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing.

In summary, the core architectural modification we are discussing involves inserting a Geometric Attention sub-layer in the first block of a neural network. This modification can improve the performance and accuracy of the network in various tasks. Thank you for watching!###

```
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the "Algorithm 2 transformer_block" in detail. This algorithm is used in the field of natural language processing and is a part of the transformer architecture.

Let's start by breaking down the different components of this algorithm. The first line of the algorithm is:

```
1: $s=\sqrt{\frac{36}{n_{\text {layers }}}}$
```

Here, $s$ represents the scaling factor and $n_{\text {layers }}$ is the number of layers in the transformer architecture. The scaling factor is calculated as the square root of 36 divided by the number of layers. This scaling factor is used to ensure that the output of the transformer block is of the same order of magnitude as the input.

The second line of the algorithm is:

```
2: $x=x+s \cdot$ MultiHeadSelfAttention $(x) \quad \triangleright \mathbb{R}^{L \times d}$
```

Here, $x$ represents the input to the transformer block and $MultiHeadSelfAttention$ is a function that performs multi-head self-attention on the input. The output of this function is added to the input $x$ and scaled by the scaling factor $s$. The result is a tensor of shape $L \times d$, where $L$ is the length of the input sequence and $d$ is the dimensionality of the input.

The third line of the algorithm is:

```
3: $x=x+s$. geometric_mha $(x, T) \quad \triangleright \mathbb{R}^{L \times d}$
```

Here, $geometric_mha$ is a function that performs geometric multi-head attention on the input $x$ and a set of key-value pairs $T$. The output of this function is added to the input $x$ and scaled by the scaling factor $s$. The result is again a tensor of shape $L \times d$.

The fourth and final line of the algorithm is:

```
4: $x=x+s \cdot \operatorname{SwiGLUMLP}(x) \quad \triangleright \mathbb{R}^{L \times d}$
```

Here, $\operatorname{SwiGLUMLP}$ is a function that performs a combination of a Swish activation function, a Gated Linear Unit (GLU) operation, and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) on the input $x$. The output of this function is added to the input $x$ and scaled by the scaling factor $s$. The result is again a tensor of shape $L \times d$.

In summary, the "Algorithm 2 transformer_block" is a key component of the transformer architecture used in natural language processing. It consists of four steps: scaling the input, performing multi-head self-attention, performing geometric multi-head attention, and applying a combination of Swish, GLU, and MLP operations. These steps are designed to improve the performance of the transformer architecture in tasks such as language modeling and machine translation.

ESM3-small (1.4B) is a 48-layer network, while ESM3medium (7B) has 96 layers, and ESM3-large (98B) has 216 layers. We experimented with different width-to-depth ratios and observed higher returns for depth than width. Prior work also demonstrates that modalities like ours benefit more from deeper networks $(64,65)$. Detailed network specifications can be found in Table S1.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the ESM3 network and its different configurations.

The ESM3 network is a type of neural network that is commonly used in the field of natural language processing. It is designed to process text data and generate meaningful representations of that data.

There are three different configurations of the ESM3 network that we will be discussing today: ESM3-small, ESM3-medium, and ESM3-large. These configurations differ in the number of layers they have. ESM3-small has 48 layers, ESM3-medium has 96 layers, and ESM3-large has 216 layers.

When we talk about the width-to-depth ratio of a neural network, we are referring to the number of neurons in each layer compared to the number of layers in the network. In our experiments, we found that increasing the depth of the network (i.e. adding more layers) resulted in better performance than increasing the width (i.e. adding more neurons to each layer).

This is consistent with prior work in the field, which has shown that networks like ours benefit more from deeper networks than wider ones.

If you're interested in learning more about the ESM3 network and its different configurations, we encourage you to check out Table S1 in the accompanying research paper. This table provides detailed specifications for each configuration of the network.

Thank you for watching, and we hope this video has been helpful in explaining the ESM3 network to you.

There are 7 unique input tracks to ESM3: (a) sequence (amino acid tokens), (b) structure coordinates, (c) struc- ture tokens, (d) 8-class secondary structure labels (SS8), (e) quantized solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) values, (f) function keyword tokens and (g) residue (InterPro) annotation binary features.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the various input tracks used in ESM3. ESM3 is a deep learning model that is used for protein structure prediction. It is a complex model that uses multiple input tracks to make accurate predictions.

The first input track is the sequence, which is simply the amino acid tokens that make up the protein. This is the most basic input track and is used to provide information about the order of amino acids in the protein.

The second input track is the structure coordinates, which provide information about the 3D structure of the protein. This input track is used to help the model understand the spatial relationships between different amino acids in the protein.

The third input track is the structure tokens, which are a simplified representation of the protein structure. This input track is used to help the model understand the overall shape of the protein.

The fourth input track is the 8-class secondary structure labels, which provide information about the secondary structure of the protein. This input track is used to help the model understand the local structure of the protein.

The fifth input track is the quantized solvent-accessible surface area values, which provide information about the surface area of the protein that is exposed to the solvent. This input track is used to help the model understand the protein's interaction with its environment.

The sixth input track is the function keyword tokens, which provide information about the function of the protein. This input track is used to help the model understand the biological role of the protein.

The seventh and final input track is the residue annotation binary features, which provide information about the protein's annotation. This input track is used to help the model understand the protein's classification and function.

In summary, ESM3 is a complex deep learning model that uses multiple input tracks to make accurate predictions about protein structure. These input tracks provide information about the sequence, structure, secondary structure, solvent-accessible surface area, function, and annotation of the protein. By using all of these input tracks together, ESM3 is able to make highly accurate predictions about protein structure.
==============================
There are two additional tracks used during pre-training only: (h) per-residue confidence (pLDDT) and (i) averaged confidence (pLDDT). At inference time, these values are fixed, and these tracks are equivalent to adding a constant vector $z_{\text {plddt }}$.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the use of two additional tracks during pre-training in the field of protein structure prediction. These tracks are known as per-residue confidence, or pLDDT, and averaged confidence, or pLDDT.

Let's start by defining what pLDDT is. pLDDT stands for predicted local distance difference test, and it is a measure of the confidence in the predicted structure of a protein. It is calculated by comparing the predicted structure to the actual structure of the protein, and it ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating greater confidence in the prediction.

Now, let's move on to the second track, which is the averaged confidence, or pLDDT. This track is simply the average of the pLDDT values for all residues in the protein. It is used to provide an overall measure of the confidence in the predicted structure.

During pre-training, these two tracks are used to help improve the accuracy of the protein structure prediction model. However, at inference time, these values are fixed and are equivalent to adding a constant vector $z_{\text {plddt }}$. This means that the values of pLDDT and averaged confidence are no longer updated during the prediction process.

In summary, pLDDT and averaged confidence are two additional tracks used during pre-training to improve the accuracy of protein structure prediction models. They are measures of the confidence in the predicted structure, with pLDDT being a per-residue measure and averaged confidence being an overall measure. At inference time, these values are fixed and are equivalent to adding a constant vector.

Structure coordinates are parsed through the Geometric Attention and are not embedded.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of structure coordinates being parsed through the Geometric Attention and not being embedded.

First, let's define what we mean by structure coordinates. In the context of this discussion, structure coordinates refer to the coordinates of a particular structure or object within a larger system or environment. For example, if we were looking at a map of a city, the structure coordinates might refer to the location of a specific building within that city.

Now, let's talk about what it means for these structure coordinates to be parsed through the Geometric Attention. The Geometric Attention is a type of neural network architecture that is used in computer vision and natural language processing tasks. It is designed to help the system focus on specific parts of an image or text that are most relevant to the task at hand.

When we say that the structure coordinates are parsed through the Geometric Attention, we mean that the system is using this neural network architecture to identify and focus on the specific coordinates of the structure in question. This allows the system to more accurately and efficiently process information related to that structure.

Finally, let's discuss what it means for the structure coordinates to not be embedded. Embedding is a technique used in machine learning and natural language processing where high-dimensional data is transformed into a lower-dimensional space. This can be useful for tasks like clustering or classification.

However, in the context of this discussion, we are saying that the structure coordinates are not embedded. This means that they are not being transformed into a lower-dimensional space, but are instead being processed directly by the Geometric Attention. This allows for more precise and accurate processing of the structure coordinates.

In summary, when we say that structure coordinates are parsed through the Geometric Attention and are not embedded, we are referring to a specific technique used in computer vision and natural language processing tasks. This technique allows the system to more accurately and efficiently process information related to specific structures or objects within a larger system or environment.
==============================
For keyword-based function tokens, each of the eight integers per residue is converted to a "sub-embedding" (Appendix A.1.5.1 line 5), then concatenated to form the perresidue embedding (Appendix A.1.5.1 line 6). For InterPro residue annotations, the inputs are multi-hot. To create an embedding vector, we sum the embeddings for each of the "on" features (equivalent to the matrix-multiply on Appendix A.1.5.1 line 7).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the process of converting keyword-based function tokens and InterPro residue annotations into embeddings.

First, let's define what we mean by "embeddings". Embeddings are a way of representing data in a high-dimensional space, where each dimension represents a different feature or characteristic of the data. In the context of this video, we will be discussing embeddings in the context of protein sequences.

Now, let's talk about keyword-based function tokens. These are essentially keywords that describe the function of a protein. For example, a protein might have the keyword "enzyme" or "transporter". Each of these keywords is represented by a set of eight integers, which are then converted into a "sub-embedding". A sub-embedding is a smaller embedding that represents a specific aspect of the data. In this case, each sub-embedding represents a different aspect of the protein's function.

Once we have the sub-embeddings, we concatenate them to form the per-residue embedding. This is essentially a larger embedding that represents the entire protein sequence.

Now, let's talk about InterPro residue annotations. These are annotations that describe the function of specific residues within a protein sequence. For example, a residue might be annotated as a "binding site" or a "catalytic site". These annotations are represented as multi-hot vectors, which means that each vector has multiple "on" features.

To create an embedding vector for these annotations, we sum the embeddings for each of the "on" features. This is equivalent to the matrix-multiply operation described in Appendix A.1.5.1 line 7.

In summary, we have discussed the process of converting keyword-based function tokens and InterPro residue annotations into embeddings. These embeddings are a powerful tool for representing protein sequences and can be used in a variety of applications, such as protein function prediction and protein-protein interaction prediction.

The largest model, 98B has an additional taxonomy track detailed in Appendix A.1.9.2, only enabled in the final $30 \mathrm{~K}$ steps of pre-training.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference related to the field of machine learning. The reference in question is about a model called 98B, which has an additional taxonomy track that is only enabled in the final $30 \mathrm{~K}$ steps of pre-training.

Let's start by breaking down the terms used in this reference. The first term is "model", which refers to a machine learning algorithm that is used to make predictions or classifications based on input data. In this case, the model is called 98B, which is likely a specific type of machine learning algorithm.

The next term is "taxonomy track", which refers to a specific feature or component of the 98B model. A taxonomy is a hierarchical classification system, so a taxonomy track likely refers to a part of the model that is responsible for classifying data into different categories based on a hierarchical structure.

The term "pre-training" refers to the process of training a machine learning model on a large dataset before it is used for making predictions or classifications on new data. In this case, the taxonomy track is only enabled in the final $30 \mathrm{~K}$ steps of pre-training, which means that it is only used during the last part of the training process.

Finally, the term "steps" refers to the number of times the model is trained on the dataset during pre-training. In this case, the taxonomy track is only enabled in the final $30 \mathrm{~K}$ steps, which means that it is only used during the last 30,000 times the model is trained on the dataset.

So, to summarize, the reference is about a machine learning model called 98B, which has a specific feature called a taxonomy track that is only used during the final $30 \mathrm{~K}$ steps of pre-training. This likely means that the taxonomy track is used to classify data into different categories based on a hierarchical structure, and is only used during the last part of the training process.

I hope this explanation has been helpful in understanding this reference related to machine learning. If you have any further questions or would like more information, please feel free to leave a comment below. Thank you for watching!###

The embeddings are all summed as input to the first layer in the network architecture.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of embeddings in the context of neural networks.

Embeddings are a way of representing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space. In the context of neural networks, embeddings are used to represent words or other discrete objects as dense vectors. These vectors are learned during the training process and capture the semantic meaning of the objects they represent.

Now, let's talk about the specific statement: "The embeddings are all summed as input to the first layer in the network architecture."

In this statement, "the embeddings" refer to the dense vectors that represent the input data. "Summed" means that all of these vectors are added together to create a single vector that represents the entire input. This single vector is then used as input to the first layer of the neural network.

The first layer of a neural network is typically a dense layer, which means that it takes in a vector of input and produces a vector of output. By summing the embeddings and using them as input to the first layer, we are essentially providing the network with a summary of the input data that captures the most important information.

In summary, embeddings are a way of representing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space, and summing the embeddings as input to the first layer of a neural network allows the network to capture the most important information from the input data.

I hope this explanation has been helpful. If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask in the comments below. Thank you for watching!###

------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the "Algorithm 3 encode_inputs" in detail. This algorithm is used in the field of protein structure prediction and is a crucial step in the process.

Let's start by breaking down the different inputs used in this algorithm. The first input is $\mathrm{x}_{\text {inputs }}$, which is a set of different features that are used to predict the protein structure. These features include $x_{\text {seq }}$, which represents the amino acid sequence of the protein, $x_{\text {structure }}$, which represents the predicted secondary structure of the protein, $x_{\text {ss } 8}$, which represents the predicted 8-state secondary structure of the protein, $x_{\text {sasa }}$, which represents the solvent accessible surface area of the protein, $x_{\text {func }}$, which represents the predicted function of the protein, $x_{\text {res }}$, which represents the residue contact map of the protein, and $x_{\text {plddt }}$, which represents the predicted local distance difference test score of the protein.

The next step in the algorithm is to embed each of these features into a vector space using a neural network. This is done using the $\operatorname{embed}\left(\cdot\right)$ function, which takes in a feature and outputs a vector representation of that feature. For example, $z_{\text {seq }}=\operatorname{embed}\left(x_{\text {seq }}\right)$ embeds the amino acid sequence of the protein into a vector space.

Once all the features have been embedded, they are concatenated together to form a final vector representation of the protein. This is done using the $\Delta$ operator, which concatenates the different vectors along the row dimension.

Finally, the algorithm returns the final vector representation of the protein, which can be used as input to a neural network for protein structure prediction.

I hope this explanation has been helpful in understanding the "Algorithm 3 encode_inputs" in detail. If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask in the comments below. Thank you for watching!

We use a regression_head to take in $d$ dimensional last layer hidden features and produce $c_{\text {track }}$-dimensional logits for each of the tracks, where $c_{\text {track }}$ corresponds to the size of the vocabulary per track. Note that for the keyword function tokens, we produce $c_{\text {func }} \times 8$ logits, and softmax over each of the 8 independently when calculating the loss.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the use of a regression_head in the context of a specific field.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those not specializing in this field. A regression_head is a type of neural network architecture that is used to predict continuous values. In this case, we are using it to predict logits, which are the raw output values of a neural network before they are transformed into probabilities.

Next, we have the term "last layer hidden features". These are the outputs of the final hidden layer of a neural network, which are used as input to the regression_head. In this case, the last layer hidden features are $d$ dimensional, meaning they have $d$ values.

Now, let's talk about "logits". These are the raw output values of the regression_head, which are used to predict the probability of a certain outcome. In this case, we are producing $c_{\text {track }}$-dimensional logits for each of the tracks. The term "tracks" refers to a specific set of data that we are analyzing, and $c_{\text {track }}$ corresponds to the size of the vocabulary per track.

Finally, we have the term "keyword function tokens". These are a specific type of data that we are analyzing, and we are producing $c_{\text {func }} \times 8$ logits for them. The term "softmax" refers to a mathematical function that is used to convert the logits into probabilities. In this case, we are softmaxing over each of the 8 independently when calculating the loss.

So, to summarize, we are using a regression_head to predict logits for each of the tracks, and we are producing $c_{\text {track }}$-dimensional logits for each of the tracks. For the keyword function tokens, we are producing $c_{\text {func }} \times 8$ logits and softmaxing over each of the 8 independently when calculating the loss.

Algorithm 4 regression_head
Input: $x \in \mathbb{R}^{\cdots \times d}$
    1: $z=\operatorname{proj}_{\text {in }}(x)$
    2: $z=\operatorname{GeLU}(z)$
    3: $z=\operatorname{LayerNorm}(z)$
    4: $z=\operatorname{proj}_{\text {out }}(z)$
    return $z$
```
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing Algorithm 4 regression_head. This algorithm is used in the field of machine learning, specifically in the context of regression analysis.

Let's start by breaking down the algorithm step by step.

Step 1: $z=\operatorname{proj}_{\text {in }}(x)$

In this step, we are projecting the input $x$ onto a lower-dimensional space. The projection is done using a matrix $\text {in }$, which is learned during the training process. This step helps to reduce the dimensionality of the input and make it easier to process.

Step 2: $z=\operatorname{GeLU}(z)$

In this step, we apply the GeLU activation function to the projected input $z$. The GeLU function is a type of activation function that is similar to the ReLU function, but with a smoother curve. This step helps to introduce non-linearity into the model and make it more expressive.

Step 3: $z=\operatorname{LayerNorm}(z)$

In this step, we apply layer normalization to the output of the GeLU function. Layer normalization is a technique that helps to improve the stability and performance of the model by normalizing the activations of each layer. This step helps to ensure that the model is well-behaved and does not suffer from issues like vanishing or exploding gradients.

Step 4: $z=\operatorname{proj}_{\text {out }}(z)$

In this final step, we project the normalized activations onto a higher-dimensional space using a matrix $\text {out }$. This step helps to increase the expressiveness of the model and make it better suited for regression tasks.

Overall, Algorithm 4 regression_head is a powerful tool for regression analysis in machine learning. By projecting the input onto a lower-dimensional space, introducing non-linearity with the GeLU function, normalizing the activations with layer normalization, and projecting onto a higher-dimensional space, this algorithm is able to make accurate predictions and generalize well to new data.

Except for structure coordinates, we output predictions for each of the tracks detailed in Appendix A.1.5.1: (a) sequence, (b) structure tokens, (c) SS8, (d) quantized SASA, (e) function keyword tokens and (f) residue (InterPro) annotation binary features.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the output predictions for each of the tracks detailed in Appendix A.1.5.1.

First, let's define what we mean by "tracks". In this context, tracks refer to different types of data that are used to make predictions about protein structures. These tracks include:

(a) Sequence: This refers to the amino acid sequence of the protein being studied. The sequence is a string of letters that represent the different types of amino acids that make up the protein.

(b) Structure tokens: These are a way of representing the 3D structure of the protein. Each token represents a specific type of structural element, such as an alpha helix or a beta sheet.

(c) SS8: This is a type of secondary structure prediction that is based on the amino acid sequence of the protein. It predicts whether each amino acid is part of an alpha helix, beta sheet, or other type of secondary structure.

(d) Quantized SASA: This refers to the solvent accessible surface area of the protein. It is a measure of how much of the protein is exposed to the surrounding environment.

(e) Function keyword tokens: These are a way of representing the function of the protein. Each token represents a specific type of function, such as enzyme activity or DNA binding.

(f) Residue (InterPro) annotation binary features: These are binary features that represent the presence or absence of specific functional domains or motifs in the protein.

By analyzing these different tracks, we can make predictions about the structure and function of the protein. We hope this explanation has been helpful. Thank you for watching!###
==============================
Except for the multi-hot residue annotations, all other tracks are predicted as a categorical distribution over possible tokens.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of multi-hot residue annotations and categorical distributions in the context of bioinformatics.

First, let's define what we mean by multi-hot residue annotations. In bioinformatics, a residue refers to a specific amino acid or nucleotide in a protein or DNA sequence. Multi-hot residue annotations refer to the process of labeling each residue with multiple possible annotations or labels. For example, a single amino acid in a protein sequence could be labeled as both hydrophobic and positively charged.

Now, let's move on to categorical distributions. In machine learning, a categorical distribution is a probability distribution over a finite number of discrete categories or labels. In the context of bioinformatics, this means that the predicted annotations for each residue are represented as a probability distribution over a set of possible tokens or labels.

For example, if we are trying to predict the function of a protein sequence, the possible tokens or labels might include things like "enzyme," "structural protein," or "transporter." The predicted annotations for each residue would then be represented as a probability distribution over these possible tokens.

It's important to note that all tracks in the context of bioinformatics are predicted as categorical distributions over possible tokens, except for the multi-hot residue annotations. This means that the predicted annotations for each residue are represented as a probability distribution over a set of possible tokens, rather than being labeled with multiple possible annotations.

In summary, multi-hot residue annotations refer to the process of labeling each residue with multiple possible annotations, while categorical distributions refer to the representation of predicted annotations as a probability distribution over a set of possible tokens.

I hope this explanation has been helpful in clarifying these concepts for you. If you have any further questions or would like more information, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for watching!###

As mentioned in Appendix A.1.5.1, ESM3 processes structural information in two independent ways:
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the ESM3 process and how it handles structural information.

First, let's define what ESM3 stands for. ESM3 is an acronym for the Enhanced Surveillance Mechanism 3, which is a system used by the European Union to monitor the economic and financial situation of its member states.

Now, let's talk about how ESM3 processes structural information. According to Appendix A.1.5.1, ESM3 processes structural information in two independent ways.

The first way is through the use of macroeconomic indicators. These indicators are used to assess the overall health of a country's economy. Examples of macroeconomic indicators include GDP, inflation, and unemployment rates.

The second way is through the use of microeconomic indicators. These indicators are used to assess the performance of specific sectors or industries within a country's economy. Examples of microeconomic indicators include stock market indices, corporate earnings, and consumer confidence surveys.

By using both macroeconomic and microeconomic indicators, ESM3 is able to provide a comprehensive analysis of a country's economic and financial situation. This information is then used by policymakers to make informed decisions about economic policy.

In conclusion, ESM3 is an important tool used by the European Union to monitor the economic and financial situation of its member states. By processing structural information through the use of macroeconomic and microeconomic indicators, ESM3 is able to provide a comprehensive analysis of a country's economic and financial situation.

Geometric Attention Described in Algorithm 6, this leverages fine-grained 3D information via conditioning on exact coordinates. We find that conditioning on coordinates is critical to good inverse folding performance. Coordinates are only used as model inputs.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of Geometric Attention as described in Algorithm 6. This algorithm leverages fine-grained 3D information via conditioning on exact coordinates.

Now, let's break down some of the terms used in this description.

First, we have Geometric Attention. This refers to a technique used in machine learning that allows a model to focus on specific parts of an input when making predictions. In the context of 3D modeling, this means that the model can pay attention to specific parts of a 3D object when making predictions about its shape or structure.

Next, we have Algorithm 6. This is a specific algorithm that implements Geometric Attention in the context of 3D modeling. It is a mathematical formula that takes in 3D data and outputs predictions about the shape or structure of the object.

Now, let's talk about the concept of conditioning on exact coordinates. This means that the algorithm is using the exact coordinates of points in 3D space as input to make predictions about the object. By using this fine-grained information, the algorithm can make more accurate predictions about the shape and structure of the object.

Finally, we have the statement that coordinates are only used as model inputs. This means that the algorithm is not directly manipulating the coordinates of the 3D object, but rather using them as input to make predictions about the object's shape or structure.

In summary, Geometric Attention as described in Algorithm 6 is a technique used in 3D modeling that allows a model to focus on specific parts of an input when making predictions. It leverages fine-grained 3D information via conditioning on exact coordinates, which allows for more accurate predictions about the shape and structure of the object. Coordinates are only used as model inputs, and the algorithm does not directly manipulate the coordinates of the 3D object.

Structure Tokens Described in Appendix A.1.7, structure tokens enable faster learning due to rich local neighborhood semantics being compressed into tokens. Structure tokens are generally used as model outputs.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of structure tokens as described in Appendix A.1.7.

Structure tokens are a type of token that are used in machine learning models to enable faster learning. They are particularly useful in situations where there is a rich local neighborhood semantics that needs to be compressed into tokens.

To understand what structure tokens are, it is important to first understand what tokens are. Tokens are essentially small units of data that are used in machine learning models to represent different aspects of the input data. For example, in natural language processing, tokens might represent individual words or phrases.

Structure tokens are a specific type of token that are used to represent the structure of the input data. This might include things like the relationships between different words in a sentence, or the hierarchical structure of a document.

One of the key benefits of using structure tokens is that they can help to compress rich local neighborhood semantics into a more compact form. This can be particularly useful in situations where there is a lot of data to process, as it can help to reduce the amount of computational resources required.

In terms of how structure tokens are used in machine learning models, they are typically used as model outputs. This means that they are generated by the model as part of the prediction process, and can be used to provide insights into the structure of the input data.

Overall, structure tokens are an important concept in machine learning, particularly in situations where there is a rich local neighborhood semantics that needs to be compressed into tokens. By using structure tokens, it is possible to enable faster learning and reduce the amount of computational resources required.

Geometric attention enables high-throughput encoding of protein structures. Protein backbone structure can be represented by the relative distance and orientation of frames defined by each residue's backbone coordinates. Reasoning over the relative orientation of frames is important to capture the local backbone geometry when only partial structure is provided. Geometric attention is an $S E(3)$ invariant allto-all attention mechanism which reasons over the relative distances and orientations of all defined frames in the input (Fig. S2). Because this attention operation can be realized using the same computational primitives as attention, it is readily scalable.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on geometric attention for high-throughput encoding of protein structures. In this video, we will be discussing the concept of geometric attention and how it can be used to encode protein structures.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those who are not experts in this field. Protein backbone structure refers to the three-dimensional arrangement of the protein's backbone atoms, which are the nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen atoms that make up the protein's backbone. These atoms are connected by peptide bonds, which form the backbone of the protein.

To represent the protein backbone structure, we can use frames defined by each residue's backbone coordinates. A residue is a building block of a protein, and it consists of a backbone atom and side chain atoms. By defining frames for each residue, we can capture the relative distance and orientation of the backbone atoms.

Now, let's talk about geometric attention. Geometric attention is an all-to-all attention mechanism that is $S E(3)$ invariant. This means that it is invariant to rotations and translations in three-dimensional space. The attention mechanism reasons over the relative distances and orientations of all defined frames in the input.

To understand how geometric attention works, let's take a look at Figure S2. In this figure, we have a protein backbone structure represented by frames defined by each residue's backbone coordinates. The geometric attention mechanism reasons over the relative distances and orientations of all defined frames in the input. This allows it to capture the local backbone geometry even when only partial structure is provided.

Finally, it's worth noting that geometric attention can be realized using the same computational primitives as attention, which makes it readily scalable. This means that it can be used to encode protein structures at a high-throughput rate, which is important for many applications in the field of protein structure prediction.

In conclusion, geometric attention is a powerful tool for encoding protein structures. By reasoning over the relative distances and orientations of all defined frames in the input, it can capture the local backbone geometry even when only partial structure is provided. And because it is readily scalable, it can be used to encode protein structures at a high-throughput rate. Thank you for watching!###

We first provide an overview of frames, and then describe how geometric attention uses them:
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on frames and geometric attention. In this video, we will be discussing the concept of frames and how they are used in geometric attention.

First, let's define what frames are. In the context of computer vision, a frame is a single image or video frame that is captured by a camera or sensor. These frames are then used to create a sequence of images or video that can be analyzed and processed by computer algorithms.

Now, let's move on to geometric attention. Geometric attention is a technique used in computer vision that allows a model to focus on specific regions of an image or video frame. This is done by creating a set of geometric features that are used to identify and track objects within the frame.

To accomplish this, geometric attention uses a set of predefined geometric shapes, such as circles, squares, and triangles, to identify and track objects within the frame. These shapes are then used to create a set of geometric features that are used to identify and track objects within the frame.

For example, if we are analyzing a video of a soccer game, we might use geometric attention to track the movement of the ball. We would first define a set of geometric shapes that are similar to the shape of the ball, such as circles or ovals. We would then use these shapes to create a set of geometric features that are used to track the movement of the ball within the frame.

In summary, frames are a fundamental concept in computer vision that are used to capture and analyze images and video. Geometric attention is a technique used in computer vision that allows a model to focus on specific regions of an image or video frame by creating a set of geometric features that are used to identify and track objects within the frame.

Frames are representations that encapsulate the 3D positional and rotational information of residue backbones and sidechains in a protein structure. We use a formulation similar to Ingraham et al. (66). Each frame $T \in S E(3)$ consists of a rotation matrix $\mathbf{R} \in S O(3)$ and a translation vector $\mathbf{t} \in \mathbb{R}^{3}$
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of frames in protein structures. Frames are a way of representing the 3D positional and rotational information of residue backbones and sidechains in a protein structure.

To understand frames, we need to first understand a few key terms. The first is $S E(3)$, which stands for the special Euclidean group. This is a group of transformations that includes rotations and translations in 3D space.

The second term we need to understand is $S O(3)$, which stands for the special orthogonal group. This is a subgroup of $S E(3)$ that includes only rotations in 3D space.

Now, let's talk about frames themselves. Each frame $T \in S E(3)$ consists of two components: a rotation matrix $\mathbf{R} \in S O(3)$ and a translation vector $\mathbf{t} \in \mathbb{R}^{3}$. The rotation matrix represents the orientation of the protein structure, while the translation vector represents its position in 3D space.

In summary, frames are a way of representing the 3D positional and rotational information of protein structures using a combination of a rotation matrix and a translation vector. Understanding frames is important for analyzing and comparing protein structures, and can help us gain insights into their function and evolution.

------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the definition of a frame for residue $i$. This concept is commonly used in the field of robotics and computer vision.

To begin, let's define what we mean by a frame. A frame is a mathematical object that represents a transformation between two coordinate systems. In this case, we are interested in transforming coordinates from one system to another in 3D space.

Now, let's break down the definition of a frame for residue $i$. The frame is denoted by $T_{i}$ and is a member of the special Euclidean group, denoted by $S E(3)$. This group consists of all transformations that preserve the Euclidean distance between points in 3D space.

The frame $T_{i}$ is composed of two parts: the rotation matrix $\mathbf{R}_{i}$ and the translation vector $\mathbf{t}_{i}$. The rotation matrix is a 3x3 matrix that represents a rotation in 3D space. The translation vector is a 3x1 vector that represents a translation in 3D space.

The frame $T_{i}$ is represented as a 4x4 matrix, where the first three rows represent the rotation matrix and the last row represents the translation vector. The last column of the matrix is always set to 1, which is a common convention in robotics and computer vision.

In summary, a frame for residue $i$ is a mathematical object that represents a transformation between two coordinate systems in 3D space. It is composed of a rotation matrix and a translation vector, and is a member of the special Euclidean group. Understanding this concept is important for anyone working in the field of robotics and computer vision. Thank you for watching!###

------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference in the field of $S O(3)$. In this reference, we have $\mathbf{R}_{i} \in S O(3)$ and $\mathbf{t}_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{3}$.

Let's start by explaining what $S O(3)$ is. $S O(3)$ is the special orthogonal group in three dimensions. It is a Lie group that consists of all rotations in three-dimensional space. These rotations preserve the orientation and distance between points.

Now, let's move on to $\mathbf{R}_{i}$. This is a rotation matrix that belongs to the group $S O(3)$. It is a 3x3 matrix that represents a rotation around some axis in three-dimensional space. The subscript $i$ is used to denote that there may be multiple rotation matrices involved in the problem at hand.

Next, we have $\mathbf{t}_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{3}$. This is a translation vector that belongs to the three-dimensional real vector space. It is a 3x1 column vector that represents a displacement from one point to another in three-dimensional space. Again, the subscript $i$ is used to denote that there may be multiple translation vectors involved in the problem at hand.

In summary, this reference is discussing a problem that involves multiple rotation matrices and translation vectors in three-dimensional space. These belong to the special orthogonal group and the three-dimensional real vector space, respectively.
==============================
Rotation Matrix: The rotation matrix $\mathbf{R}_{i}$ for residue $i$ is composed of three 3-dimensional vectors $\left[\hat{x}, \hat{e}_{1}, \hat{e}_{2}\right]$ :
1. $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{e}_{1}$ are orthogonal unit vectors on the $N-$ $C_{\alpha}-C$ plane.
2. $\hat{e}_{2}$ is a unit vector perpendicular to both $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{e}_{1}$.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on rotation matrices in the field of protein structure analysis. In this video, we will be discussing the rotation matrix and its components in detail.

The rotation matrix is a mathematical tool used to describe the rotation of a protein structure. It is composed of three 3-dimensional vectors, which are represented by the variables $\mathbf{R}_{i}$. These vectors are used to describe the orientation of a protein residue, which is represented by the variable $i$.

The first vector in the rotation matrix is $\hat{x}$. This vector is a unit vector that is orthogonal to the $N-$ $C_{\alpha}-C$ plane. The $N-$ $C_{\alpha}-C$ plane is a plane that is perpendicular to the peptide bond between two amino acids in a protein. The $\hat{x}$ vector is used to describe the orientation of the protein residue in this plane.

The second vector in the rotation matrix is $\hat{e}_{1}$. This vector is also a unit vector that is orthogonal to the $N-$ $C_{\alpha}-C$ plane. However, it is perpendicular to the $\hat{x}$ vector. The $\hat{e}_{1}$ vector is used to describe the orientation of the protein residue in a plane that is perpendicular to the $N-$ $C_{\alpha}-C$ plane.

The third vector in the rotation matrix is $\hat{e}_{2}$. This vector is a unit vector that is perpendicular to both the $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{e}_{1}$ vectors. It is used to describe the orientation of the protein residue in a plane that is perpendicular to both the $N-$ $C_{\alpha}-C$ plane and the plane perpendicular to the $N-$ $C_{\alpha}-C$ plane.

In summary, the rotation matrix is a mathematical tool used to describe the orientation of a protein residue. It is composed of three 3-dimensional vectors, which are used to describe the orientation of the protein residue in different planes. The $\hat{x}$ vector is used to describe the orientation of the protein residue in the $N-$ $C_{\alpha}-C$ plane, the $\hat{e}_{1}$ vector is used to describe the orientation of the protein residue in a plane perpendicular to the $N-$ $C_{\alpha}-C$ plane, and the $\hat{e}_{2}$ vector is used to describe the orientation of the protein residue in a plane perpendicular to both the $N-$ $C_{\alpha}-C$ plane and the plane perpendicular to the $N-$ $C_{\alpha}-C$ plane.

This matrix rotates vectors to a local coordinate system where the $N-C_{\alpha}-C$ plane for the corresponding residue spans the $x y$ plane.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of rotating vectors to a local coordinate system. This is a technique commonly used in the field of molecular dynamics simulations, and it involves transforming the coordinates of atoms in a molecule to a new reference frame that is centered on a specific atom or group of atoms.

In this particular case, we are interested in rotating vectors to a local coordinate system where the $N-C_{\alpha}-C$ plane for the corresponding residue spans the $x y$ plane. Let's break down this statement and explain what each term means.

$N$ refers to the nitrogen atom in the amino acid residue. $C_{\alpha}$ is the carbon atom that is directly attached to the nitrogen atom, and $C$ is the carbon atom that is attached to the $C_{\alpha}$ atom. Together, these three atoms form a plane that is perpendicular to the backbone of the protein.

The $x y$ plane is simply the two-dimensional plane that is defined by the $x$ and $y$ axes. By rotating the vectors to this local coordinate system, we can simplify the calculations involved in analyzing the motion of the protein.

So, in summary, rotating vectors to a local coordinate system where the $N-C_{\alpha}-C$ plane for the corresponding residue spans the $x y$ plane is a technique used in molecular dynamics simulations to simplify the analysis of protein motion. We hope this explanation has been helpful, and thank you for watching!###

Translation Vector: The translation vector $\mathbf{t}_{i}$ specifies the position of the residue's $C_{\alpha}$.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of translation vectors in the field of protein structure analysis.

In protein structure analysis, a translation vector is a mathematical tool used to describe the position of a specific amino acid residue within a protein structure. The translation vector is represented by a vector, denoted as $\mathbf{t}_{i}$, which specifies the position of the residue's $C_{\alpha}$.

Now, let's break down some of the terms used in this definition.

First, a residue refers to a specific amino acid within a protein structure. Each amino acid has a unique side chain, which contributes to the overall shape and function of the protein.

Next, the $C_{\alpha}$ atom is a specific atom within the amino acid residue. It is located in the backbone of the amino acid and is often used as a reference point for describing the position of the residue within the protein structure.

Finally, a vector is a mathematical object that has both magnitude and direction. In the context of protein structure analysis, the translation vector $\mathbf{t}_{i}$ specifies the position of the $C_{\alpha}$ atom of a specific residue within the protein structure.

In summary, a translation vector is a mathematical tool used to describe the position of a specific amino acid residue within a protein structure. It is represented by a vector, denoted as $\mathbf{t}_{i}$, which specifies the position of the residue's $C_{\alpha}$.

Transformation: To transform a point $\mathbf{p} \in \mathbb{R}^{3}$ from the local frame of residue $i$ to the global coordinate system, the following equation is used:
$$
\mathbf{p}_{\text {global }}=T_{i}(\mathbf{p})=\mathbf{R}_{i} \mathbf{p}+\mathbf{t}_{i}
$$
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on the transformation of points in 3D space. In this video, we will be discussing the process of transforming a point from a local frame of reference to a global coordinate system.

To begin, let's define some terms. A frame of reference is a set of axes that are used to describe the position and motion of objects in space. A local frame of reference is a set of axes that are fixed to a specific object or point in space, while a global coordinate system is a set of axes that are fixed to the entire space.

Now, let's talk about the transformation process. To transform a point $\mathbf{p} \in \mathbb{R}^{3}$ from the local frame of residue $i$ to the global coordinate system, we use the following equation:

$$
\mathbf{p}_{\text {global }}=T_{i}(\mathbf{p})=\mathbf{R}_{i} \mathbf{p}+\mathbf{t}_{i}
$$

Here, $\mathbf{p}$ is the point we want to transform, $\mathbf{p}_{\text {global }}$ is the transformed point in the global coordinate system, $\mathbf{R}_{i}$ is the rotation matrix that describes the orientation of the local frame of reference with respect to the global coordinate system, and $\mathbf{t}_{i}$ is the translation vector that describes the position of the local frame of reference with respect to the global coordinate system.

The rotation matrix $\mathbf{R}_{i}$ is a 3x3 matrix that describes the orientation of the local frame of reference with respect to the global coordinate system. It is calculated using the Euler angles or the quaternion representation of the orientation.

The translation vector $\mathbf{t}_{i}$ is a 3x1 vector that describes the position of the local frame of reference with respect to the global coordinate system. It is calculated using the coordinates of the origin of the local frame of reference in the global coordinate system.

In summary, to transform a point from a local frame of reference to a global coordinate system, we use the equation $\mathbf{p}_{\text {global }}=T_{i}(\mathbf{p})=\mathbf{R}_{i} \mathbf{p}+\mathbf{t}_{i}$, where $\mathbf{R}_{i}$ is the rotation matrix and $\mathbf{t}_{i}$ is the translation vector.

Inverse Transformation: To transform a point $\mathbf{p}_{\text {global }} \in$ $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ from the global coordinate system back to the local frame of residue $i$, the following equation is used:
$$
\mathbf{p}=T_{i}^{-1}\left(\mathbf{p}_{\text {global }}\right)=\mathbf{R}_{i}^{-1}\left(\mathbf{p}_{\text {global }}-\mathbf{t}_{i}\right)
$$
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on inverse transformation in the field of computer graphics. In this video, we will be discussing the concept of inverse transformation and how it is used to transform a point from the global coordinate system back to the local frame of a specific residue.

To understand inverse transformation, we first need to understand the concept of coordinate systems. In computer graphics, a coordinate system is a way of representing the position of an object in 3D space. There are two types of coordinate systems: global and local. The global coordinate system is the overall coordinate system that represents the entire scene, while the local coordinate system is specific to each object in the scene.

Now, let's talk about inverse transformation. Inverse transformation is the process of transforming a point from the global coordinate system back to the local frame of a specific residue. This is done using a transformation matrix called the inverse transformation matrix.

The inverse transformation matrix is calculated using the following equation:

$$
\mathbf{p}=T_{i}^{-1}\left(\mathbf{p}_{\text {global }}\right)=\mathbf{R}_{i}^{-1}\left(\mathbf{p}_{\text {global }}-\mathbf{t}_{i}\right)
$$

In this equation, $\mathbf{p}$ is the point in the global coordinate system that needs to be transformed back to the local frame of residue $i$. $\mathbf{p}_{\text {global }}$ is the point in the global coordinate system that needs to be transformed. $\mathbf{R}_{i}$ is the rotation matrix for residue $i$, and $\mathbf{t}_{i}$ is the translation vector for residue $i$.

The inverse transformation matrix is calculated by first subtracting the translation vector $\mathbf{t}_{i}$ from the global coordinate system point $\mathbf{p}_{\text {global }}$. This gives us the point $\mathbf{p}_{\text {local }}$ in the local coordinate system of residue $i$.

Next, we calculate the inverse of the rotation matrix $\mathbf{R}_{i}$. This gives us the inverse transformation matrix $\mathbf{T}_{i}^{-1}$.

Finally, we multiply the inverse transformation matrix $\mathbf{T}_{i}^{-1}$ by the global coordinate system point $\mathbf{p}_{\text {global }}$ to get the point $\mathbf{p}$ in the local coordinate system of residue $i$.

In summary, inverse transformation is the process of transforming a point from the global coordinate system back to the local frame of a specific residue. This is done using the inverse transformation matrix, which is calculated using the rotation matrix and translation vector for the specific residue.

Figure S2. Geometric attention. Geometric attention is an $\mathrm{SE}(3)$ invariant all-to-all attention mechanism where the attention score matrix is a weighted sum of two terms: (1) the pairwise distances between queries and keys rotated and translated by their respective backbone frames, and (2) the pairwise dot products between queries and keys rotated by their respective backbone frames. This attention mechanism encodes structural information with throughput comparable to the standard attention operation in transformers.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of geometric attention. This is a term that is used in the field of computer vision and machine learning, specifically in the context of transformers.

To understand geometric attention, we first need to understand what transformers are. Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that are used for tasks such as natural language processing and image recognition. They are called transformers because they use a mathematical operation called the dot product to transform input data into a new representation.

Now, let's talk about geometric attention. Geometric attention is a type of attention mechanism that is used in transformers. It is called geometric attention because it takes into account the geometric structure of the input data.

In more technical terms, geometric attention is an $\mathrm{SE}(3)$ invariant all-to-all attention mechanism. This means that it is invariant to rotations and translations in 3D space. The attention score matrix is a weighted sum of two terms: (1) the pairwise distances between queries and keys rotated and translated by their respective backbone frames, and (2) the pairwise dot products between queries and keys rotated by their respective backbone frames.

The backbone frames refer to the 3D coordinate frames of the input data. The queries and keys are vectors that represent the input data. The pairwise distances and dot products are calculated between the queries and keys, and these values are used to determine the attention score matrix.

The attention score matrix is then used to weight the input data, giving more importance to the parts of the input data that are most relevant to the task at hand. This allows the transformer to focus on the most important parts of the input data, which can improve the accuracy of the model.

In summary, geometric attention is a type of attention mechanism used in transformers that takes into account the geometric structure of the input data. It is an $\mathrm{SE}(3)$ invariant all-to-all attention mechanism that calculates pairwise distances and dot products between queries and keys rotated and translated by their respective backbone frames. This allows the transformer to focus on the most important parts of the input data, improving the accuracy of the model.

To create frames, all we require is a translation vector $\vec{t}$, and two vectors $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ defining the local $x y$ plane after conversion to global coordinates, from which the frame $T$ can be calculated with the standard Gram-Schmidt algorithm:
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on creating frames using translation vectors, local $x y$ planes, and the Gram-Schmidt algorithm. In this video, we will be discussing the process of creating frames using these three key components.

First, let's define what we mean by a frame. A frame is a set of three orthonormal vectors that define a coordinate system in three-dimensional space. These vectors are typically denoted as $\vec{i}$, $\vec{j}$, and $\vec{k}$.

Now, let's talk about translation vectors. A translation vector is a vector that represents a shift in position from one point to another. It is typically denoted as $\vec{t}$.

Next, we have the local $x y$ plane. This is a plane that is defined by two vectors, $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$, which are perpendicular to each other and lie in the plane. These vectors are typically denoted as $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$.

Finally, we have the Gram-Schmidt algorithm. This is a mathematical algorithm that is used to find an orthonormal basis for a given set of vectors. In our case, we will be using this algorithm to find the three orthonormal vectors that define our frame.

So, how do we use these three components to create a frame? Well, first we need to convert our local $x y$ plane vectors to global coordinates. This means that we need to find the position of the origin of our local $x y$ plane in global coordinates. We can do this by finding the midpoint between the two vectors that define our local $x y$ plane.

Once we have our local $x y$ plane vectors in global coordinates, we can use the Gram-Schmidt algorithm to find the three orthonormal vectors that define our frame. The first vector in our frame will be the translation vector, $\vec{t}$. The second vector will be the normal vector of our local $x y$ plane, which we can find by taking the cross product of our two local $x y$ plane vectors. The third vector will be the cross product of the first two vectors.

And that's it! By using a translation vector, local $x y$ plane vectors, and the Gram-Schmidt algorithm, we can create a frame that defines a coordinate system in three-dimensional space.

 Hello and welcome to this video on the Gram-Schmidt algorithm. In this video, we will be discussing the implementation of the Gram-Schmidt algorithm in the context of 3D rotations.

The Gram-Schmidt algorithm is a widely used method for orthonormalizing a set of vectors. In other words, it allows us to take a set of linearly independent vectors and transform them into a set of orthonormal vectors. This is particularly useful in many areas of mathematics and engineering, including linear algebra, numerical analysis, and computer graphics.

In the context of 3D rotations, the Gram-Schmidt algorithm is used to transform a set of three vectors into a set of three orthonormal vectors that represent a rotation in 3D space. The input to the algorithm consists of three vectors: $\vec{t} \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times 3}$, $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times 3}$, and $\vec{y} \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times 3}$. These vectors are assumed to be linearly independent and represent a rotation in 3D space.

The first step of the algorithm is to normalize the vector $\vec{x}$ by dividing it by its magnitude. This gives us the vector $\hat{x}=\frac{\vec{x}}{\|\vec{x}\|}$.

The next step is to compute the vector $\vec{e}_{1}=\vec{y}-(\hat{x} \cdot \vec{y}) \hat{x}$. This vector is orthogonal to $\hat{x}$ and represents the first orthonormal vector in our new basis.

We then normalize $\vec{e}_{1}$ to obtain the vector $\hat{e}_{1}=\frac{\vec{e}_{1}}{\left\|\vec{e}_{1}\right\|}$.

The next step is to compute the vector $\hat{e}_{2}=\hat{x} \times \hat{e}_{1}$. This vector is orthogonal to both $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{e}_{1}$ and represents the second orthonormal vector in our new basis.

Finally, we combine the three vectors $\hat{x}$, $\hat{e}_{1}$, and $\hat{e}_{2}$ into a matrix $R=\left[\hat{x}, \hat{e}_{1}, \hat{e}_{2}\right] \quad \triangleright S O(3)^{L}$. This matrix represents the orthonormal basis for our rotation in 3D space.

We can then combine this matrix with the vector $\vec{t}$ to obtain the matrix $T=\left[\begin{array}{cc}R & \vec{t} \\ 0_{1} \times 3 & 1\end{array}\right] \quad \triangleright S E(3)^{L}$. This matrix represents the transformation that takes a point in 3D space to its rotated position.

In summary, the Gram-Schmidt algorithm is a powerful tool for orthonormalizing a set of vectors, and in the context of 3D rotations, it allows us to transform a set of three vectors into a set of three orthonormal vectors that represent a rotation in 3D space.

We construct frames such that the $C_{\alpha}$ is at the origin of the frame $(\vec{t}), C$ on the negative x-axis $(-\vec{x})$, and $N$ is on the $x y$-plane.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference system used in the field of biochemistry.

In this system, we construct frames with three points: $C_{\alpha}$, $C$, and $N$. These points are used to define the orientation of a protein in space.

$C_{\alpha}$ is the carbon atom in the backbone of an amino acid. It is located at the origin of the frame, which means that it is the point from which all other points are measured.

$C$ is the carbonyl carbon atom, which is located on the negative x-axis. This means that it is to the left of the origin.

$N$ is the nitrogen atom in the backbone of an amino acid. It is located on the $x y$-plane, which means that it is in the same plane as the $x$ and $y$ axes.

By using these three points, we can define the orientation of a protein in space. This is important for understanding how proteins interact with each other and with other molecules in the body.

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing Algorithm 6, which details the Geometric Self-Attention layer. This layer is used in our system twice, once in the VQ-VAE encoder for structure tokens and once in the first layer of ESM3.

Now, let's break down some of the terms used in this algorithm. First, we have the term "Geometric Self-Attention." This refers to a type of attention mechanism that is used in neural networks. Attention mechanisms are used to help the network focus on specific parts of the input data that are most relevant to the task at hand. In the case of Geometric Self-Attention, the network is able to attend to different parts of the input data based on their geometric relationships.

Next, we have the term "VQ-VAE encoder." This refers to a type of encoder that is used in our system. VQ-VAE stands for Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder. This type of encoder is used to compress high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation. In our system, it is used to encode the structure tokens, which are used to represent the structure of the input data.

Finally, we have the term "ESM3." This stands for Evolutionary Scale Modeling 3. ESM3 is a type of protein structure prediction model that is used in our system. It is based on the idea of using multiple scales of information to predict protein structures.

So, to summarize, Algorithm 6 details the Geometric Self-Attention layer, which is used in our system twice. It is used in the VQ-VAE encoder for structure tokens and in the first layer of ESM3. The VQ-VAE encoder is used to compress high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation, while ESM3 is a protein structure prediction model that uses multiple scales of information.

Unlike regular self-attention, which only operates on perresidue embeddings, Geometric Attention incorporates the per-residue frames $T$ to integrate geometric information in a rotation and translation invariant way. The process of forming the attention matrix $A$ is as follows:
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of Geometric Attention in the field of protein structure prediction.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those who are not experts in this field.

Per-residue embeddings refer to the representation of each amino acid residue in a protein structure as a vector in a high-dimensional space. These embeddings capture information about the chemical properties and spatial orientation of each residue.

Per-residue frames, denoted by $T$, refer to the 3D coordinate system that is centered on each residue in a protein structure. These frames provide information about the local geometry of the protein structure.

Now, let's discuss the concept of Geometric Attention. Unlike regular self-attention, which only operates on per-residue embeddings, Geometric Attention incorporates the per-residue frames $T$ to integrate geometric information in a rotation and translation invariant way.

The process of forming the attention matrix $A$ involves computing the dot product between the per-residue embeddings and the per-residue frames $T$. This dot product operation is performed for each pair of residues in the protein structure, resulting in a matrix $A$ that captures the geometric relationships between all pairs of residues.

By incorporating geometric information in this way, Geometric Attention has been shown to improve the accuracy of protein structure prediction models.

Thank you for watching this video, and we hope that you have gained a better understanding of the concept of Geometric Attention in protein structure prediction.

------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on QKV Projections. In this video, we will be discussing the concept of QKV Projections and how they are used in the field of machine learning.

QKV Projections are a technique used in the Transformer architecture, which is a type of neural network that is commonly used for natural language processing tasks. The Transformer architecture was introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Google in 2017.

In the Transformer architecture, QKV Projections are used to project the query, key, and value vectors into a lower-dimensional space. The query vector is used to compute the attention score, which is used to determine which parts of the input sequence are most relevant to the current position. The key vector is used to compute the attention score, and the value vector is used to compute the output of the attention mechanism.

The QKV Projections are performed using two sets of keys and queries, $\left(Q_{r}, K_{r}\right)$ and $\left(Q_{d}, K_{d}\right)$, along with $V$, all with shapes $\in \mathbb{R}^{L \times h \times 3}$. Here, $L$ is the sequence length, and $h$ is the number of heads.

The QKV Projections are performed by first linearly projecting the query, key, and value vectors into a lower-dimensional space using a learned weight matrix. The resulting vectors are then reshaped into a 2D matrix, which is used to compute the attention score.

In summary, QKV Projections are a technique used in the Transformer architecture to project the query, key, and value vectors into a lower-dimensional space. This technique is used to compute the attention score, which is used to determine which parts of the input sequence are most relevant to the current position. The QKV Projections are performed using two sets of keys and queries, along with $V$, all with shapes $\in \mathbb{R}^{L \times h \times 3}$.

2. Convert QKV to global frame: Each of the queries, keys and values are initially assumed to be in the local frame of their corresponding residue.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the process of converting QKV to global frame.

First, let's define what QKV stands for. QKV stands for queries, keys, and values. These are all terms used in the field of computer science and specifically in the context of databases.

In the context of this video, we are referring to queries, keys, and values in the context of protein structures. Each of these terms refers to a specific aspect of a protein structure.

A query is a specific question or request for information about a protein structure. For example, a query might ask for information about the location of a specific amino acid within the protein structure.

A key is a specific piece of information that is used to identify a particular aspect of a protein structure. For example, a key might be the name of a specific amino acid within the protein structure.

A value is the specific piece of information that is returned in response to a query. For example, if the query is asking for the location of a specific amino acid, the value would be the coordinates of that amino acid within the protein structure.

Now, let's discuss what it means to convert QKV to global frame.

When we talk about a frame of reference, we are referring to a specific coordinate system that is used to describe the location of objects within a three-dimensional space. In the context of protein structures, we typically use a local frame of reference that is centered on each individual amino acid within the protein structure.

However, when we want to compare the location of amino acids across different protein structures, we need to use a global frame of reference that is consistent across all structures. This is where the process of converting QKV to global frame comes in.

To convert QKV to global frame, we need to first identify the location of each amino acid within its local frame of reference. We can then use this information to calculate the coordinates of each amino acid within the global frame of reference.

This process involves a series of mathematical transformations that take into account the orientation and position of each protein structure within the global frame of reference.

In summary, converting QKV to global frame is a process used in the field of protein structure analysis to compare the location of amino acids across different protein structures. It involves identifying the location of each amino acid within its local frame of reference and then calculating its coordinates within the global frame of reference.

(a) Convert to Global Rotational Frame: We convert each of the vectors in $Q_{r}, K_{r}, V$ from their local frame (where the $x y$ plane is the $N-C_{\alpha}-C$ plane for each residue) to a global rotational frame (where the $x y$ plane is aligned for all residues) by applying $\mathbf{R}_{i}$ (Algorithm 6, lines 3, 4).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the process of converting vectors from a local frame to a global rotational frame. This is a common technique used in the field of molecular dynamics simulations.

First, let's define some terms. A vector is a mathematical object that has both magnitude and direction. In the context of molecular dynamics simulations, vectors are used to represent the position and orientation of atoms and molecules.

A local frame is a coordinate system that is specific to a particular atom or molecule. In this case, the $x y$ plane is defined by the positions of the nitrogen, carbon alpha, and carbon atoms in each residue.

A global rotational frame, on the other hand, is a coordinate system that is aligned for all residues. In this case, the $x y$ plane is aligned for all residues.

Now, let's talk about the process of converting vectors from a local frame to a global rotational frame. This is done by applying a rotation matrix, denoted by $\mathbf{R}_{i}$. This matrix is calculated using Algorithm 6, which is a mathematical algorithm used to calculate the rotation matrix for a given set of vectors.

In summary, converting vectors from a local frame to a global rotational frame is a common technique used in molecular dynamics simulations. It involves applying a rotation matrix to the vectors in order to align them with a global coordinate system.

(b) Convert to Global Distance Frame: We convert each of the vectors in $Q_{d}, K_{d}$ from their local frame to a global frame by applying $T_{i}$ (Algorithm 6 , lines 5, 6).
3. Directional Attention: The pairwise, per-head $h$ rotational similarity $R$ between keys $i$ and queries $j$ is calculated using the dot product $[R]_{i, j, h}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\left[q_{r}\right]_{i, h,:}$. $\left[k_{r}\right]_{j, h,:}$ This is equivalent to the cosine distance between projected points.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on converting vectors from a local frame to a global frame. In this video, we will be discussing the process of converting vectors from a local frame to a global frame using the algorithm 6.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those not specializing in this field. A vector is a mathematical object that has both magnitude and direction. A frame is a coordinate system that is used to represent vectors. A local frame is a coordinate system that is specific to a particular point or object, while a global frame is a coordinate system that is fixed and independent of any particular point or object.

Now, let's move on to the algorithm itself. The algorithm takes two sets of vectors, $Q_{d}$ and $K_{d}$, which are in a local frame. The goal is to convert these vectors to a global frame. To do this, we apply the transformation matrix $T_{i}$ to each vector in $Q_{d}$ and $K_{d}$. This transformation matrix is calculated using the algorithm 6, which is a standard algorithm for calculating the transformation matrix between two coordinate systems.

Once the vectors have been converted to the global frame, we can perform directional attention. This involves calculating the rotational similarity between the keys and queries. The rotational similarity is calculated using the dot product of the vectors, which is equivalent to the cosine distance between projected points.

In summary, the process of converting vectors from a local frame to a global frame involves applying a transformation matrix to each vector in the local frame. This allows us to perform directional attention and calculate the rotational similarity between the keys and queries. Thank you for watching, and we hope this video has been helpful in explaining this reference to experts.

4. Distance Attention: The pairwise, per-head $h$ distance similarity $D$ between keys $i$ and queries $j$ is computed using the $L_{2}$ norm of the difference $[D]_{i, j, h}=$ $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\left\|\left[q_{r}\right]_{i, h,:}-\left[k_{r}\right]_{j, h,:}\right\|_{2}$.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of Distance Attention. This is a term used in the field of machine learning and specifically in the context of neural networks.

To understand Distance Attention, we first need to understand what attention is. Attention is a mechanism used in neural networks that allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input data. This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets where not all the information is relevant to the task at hand.

Now, let's move on to Distance Attention. This is a specific type of attention mechanism that uses the distance between two sets of data points to determine which parts of the input data to focus on. In this case, the two sets of data points are the keys and the queries.

The keys are a set of data points that are used to generate a set of attention weights. These weights are then used to determine which parts of the input data to focus on. The queries are the parts of the input data that we want to focus on.

To compute the distance between the keys and the queries, we use the $L_{2}$ norm of the difference between the two sets of data points. The $L_{2}$ norm is a measure of the distance between two points in a two-dimensional space. In this case, we are using it to measure the distance between two sets of data points in a high-dimensional space.

The formula for computing the distance between the keys and the queries is as follows:

$[D]_{i, j, h}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\left\|\left[q_{r}\right]_{i, h,:}-\left[k_{r}\right]_{j, h,:}\right\|_{2}$

Here, $i$ and $j$ are the indices of the keys and queries, respectively. $h$ is the number of heads in the attention mechanism. $q_{r}$ and $k_{r}$ are the query and key vectors, respectively. The $\left\|\cdot\right\|_{2}$ notation represents the $L_{2}$ norm.

In summary, Distance Attention is a type of attention mechanism used in neural networks that uses the distance between two sets of data points to determine which parts of the input data to focus on. The distance is computed using the $L_{2}$ norm of the difference between the two sets of data points.

5. Scale Factor: $R$ and $D$ are scaled per-head with learned scalars $\left[\bar{w}_{r}\right]_{h}$ and $\left[\bar{w}_{d}\right]_{h}$, respectively, where $\bar{w}_{r}, \bar{w}_{d} \in \mathbb{R}^{h}$. We use the softplus function to transform weights into $[0, \infty)^{h}$. This scaling allows certain heads to specialize in attending via distance or directional attention.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of scale factor in the context of attention mechanisms.

In the field of natural language processing, attention mechanisms are used to help models focus on specific parts of input data. This is particularly useful in tasks such as machine translation, where the model needs to pay attention to different parts of the input sentence depending on the target language.

Now, let's break down the concept of scale factor. In the context of attention mechanisms, scale factor refers to the learned scalars $\left[\bar{w}_{r}\right]_{h}$ and $\left[\bar{w}_{d}\right]_{h}$, where $\bar{w}_{r}, \bar{w}_{d} \in \mathbb{R}^{h}$. These scalars are used to scale the attention weights $R$ and $D$ per-head.

The softplus function is used to transform the weights into the range $[0, \infty)^{h}$. This allows certain heads to specialize in attending via distance or directional attention.

In simpler terms, the scale factor is a way to adjust the attention weights so that certain parts of the input data are given more or less attention depending on the task at hand. This is achieved by scaling the weights per-head using learned scalars and the softplus function.

I hope this explanation has been helpful in understanding the concept of scale factor in the context of attention mechanisms. Thank you for watching!###

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the geometric multi-head attention algorithm, also known as Algorithm 6. This algorithm is used in the field of natural language processing and is a variant of the multi-head attention algorithm.

Let's start by breaking down the input parameters of the algorithm. We have $X$, which is a matrix of size $L \times d$ and represents the input data. We also have $T$, which is a set of $L$ matrices of size $SE(3)^{L}$ and represents the positional embeddings of the input data.

Next, we have $Q_{r}$, $K_{r}$, $Q_{d}$, and $K_{d}$, which are all matrices of size $L \times h \times 3$. These matrices are used to compute the attention scores between the input data and the positional embeddings.

We also have $V$, which is a matrix of size $L \times h \times 3$ and represents the linear transformation of the input data.

Moving on to the algorithm itself, we first compute the rotation matrices $R_{i}$ and translation vectors $t_{i}$ for each positional embedding in $T$. We then use these matrices to transform the query and key matrices $Q_{r}$, $K_{r}$, $Q_{d}$, and $K_{d}$.

Next, we compute the attention scores between the transformed query and key matrices using the dot product operation. We then apply a softmax function to these scores to obtain the attention weights.

We then use the attention weights to compute the output matrix $O$, which is a linear combination of the value matrix $V$ and the positional embeddings.

Finally, we update the input data matrix $X$ by adding the output matrix $O$ to it.

And that's a brief overview of the geometric multi-head attention algorithm. Thank you for watching!

Each residue is associated with one of 4,096 structure tokens ( +4 special tokens), designed to provide a rich, learned representation of its local neighborhood. The tokens are generated with a VQ-VAE encoder, with a corresponding decoder to enable decoding of generated tokens back to $3 \mathrm{D}$ coordinates.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference related to the field of protein structure prediction. In this reference, the authors have developed a method to represent each residue in a protein structure using a learned representation called a structure token.

Now, let's break down some of the terms used in this reference. First, a residue refers to an amino acid in a protein structure. There are 20 different types of amino acids that can make up a protein, and each one has a unique chemical structure.

Next, the authors have associated each residue with one of 4,096 structure tokens. These tokens are essentially a way to represent the local neighborhood of each residue in a protein structure. The idea is that by capturing the local context of each residue, we can better understand how it interacts with its neighboring residues and ultimately how the protein folds into its 3D shape.

The structure tokens are generated using a VQ-VAE encoder. VQ-VAE stands for Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder, which is a type of neural network that can learn to encode and decode complex data. In this case, the VQ-VAE encoder is used to learn a compact representation of the local neighborhood of each residue.

Finally, the authors have also included a corresponding decoder that can take the generated structure tokens and decode them back into 3D coordinates. This is important because ultimately we want to be able to predict the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence.

So, in summary, the authors have developed a method to represent each residue in a protein structure using a learned representation called a structure token. These tokens are generated using a VQ-VAE encoder and can be decoded back into 3D coordinates using a corresponding decoder. This approach has the potential to improve our ability to predict protein structures, which is an important problem in the field of structural biology.

The VQ-VAE encoder $f_{\text {enc }}$ consists of two geometric attention blocks (Transformer blocks, but self-attention replaced with geometric_mha) with an embedding width of 1024 and 128 geometric heads per geometric attention layer.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the VQ-VAE encoder and its components.

The VQ-VAE encoder is a type of neural network architecture that is used for image compression and generation. It consists of two main components: the encoder and the decoder.

The encoder is responsible for compressing the input image into a smaller representation, while the decoder is responsible for generating a new image from the compressed representation.

Now, let's take a closer look at the encoder. The encoder is made up of two geometric attention blocks, which are a type of Transformer block. These blocks are used to process the input image and generate a compressed representation.

The first geometric attention block has an embedding width of 1024, which means that it can process images with a width of 1024 pixels. The second geometric attention block has the same embedding width.

Each geometric attention block also has 128 geometric heads per geometric attention layer. This means that the attention mechanism used in these blocks is designed to work with geometric data, such as images.

In summary, the VQ-VAE encoder is a neural network architecture used for image compression and generation. It consists of two geometric attention blocks, each with an embedding width of 1024 and 128 geometric heads per geometric attention layer.

Thank you for watching, and we hope this explanation has been helpful.
==============================
The VQ-VAE encoder reasons over the backbone frames
and the relative sequence position of residues in the local structure. Relative sequence positions are encoded through a learned positional embedding. Sequence positions are determined relative to the query residue (i.e., if the query residue has residue index 56 , then the residue in index 58 has a +2 sequence position). Relative sequence positions are clamped to $+/-32$ before encoding, meaning long-range contacts share sequence positional embeddings. Relative sequence positional embeddings define the initial encoder state $N$, and has shape $L \times 16 \times d$ (Algorithm 7, line 4). Note that this means the input to the VQ-VAE encoder is purely structural: no sequence (amino acid), function or other information is used here. Furthermore, each neighborhood is processed completely independently; for each residue, the encoder only uses the information of its 16 nearest neighbors.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the VQ-VAE encoder and its role in reasoning over the backbone frames and relative sequence position of residues in the local structure.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those not specializing in this field. The VQ-VAE encoder is a type of neural network that is used to encode and decode data. It stands for Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder.

The backbone frames refer to the protein backbone, which is the chain of amino acids that make up a protein. The local structure refers to the specific arrangement of amino acids in a protein.

Now, let's dive into the details of how the VQ-VAE encoder works. It reasons over the backbone frames and relative sequence position of residues in the local structure. The relative sequence position of residues is encoded through a learned positional embedding.

Sequence positions are determined relative to the query residue, which is the residue that the encoder is currently analyzing. For example, if the query residue has a residue index of 56, then the residue in index 58 has a +2 sequence position.

Relative sequence positions are clamped to +/-32 before encoding, which means that long-range contacts share sequence positional embeddings. This is done to reduce the dimensionality of the input data and make it easier for the encoder to process.

The relative sequence positional embeddings define the initial encoder state N, which has a shape of L x 16 x d. L represents the length of the protein sequence, 16 represents the number of nearest neighbors that are considered for each residue, and d represents the dimensionality of the encoder.

It's important to note that the input to the VQ-VAE encoder is purely structural, meaning that no sequence, function, or other information is used here. Furthermore, each neighborhood is processed completely independently, which means that for each residue, the encoder only uses the information of its 16 nearest neighbors.

In summary, the VQ-VAE encoder is a powerful tool for reasoning over the backbone frames and relative sequence position of residues in the local structure. By using a learned positional embedding and clamping relative sequence positions, the encoder is able to process large amounts of data efficiently and accurately.

Geometric attention blocks operate similar to Transformer blocks in that they transform a state according to an attention operation ( geometric_mha ) and feedforward network (SwiGLU MLP). As such, the output has the same shape as the input. In this case, this means that the encoder outputs 16 latents per residue. However, we want to learn a single token, i.e., a single latent per residue, hence we take the embedding corresponding to the query residue position $N_{:, 0,:}$.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing geometric attention blocks and their use in the field of machine learning.

Geometric attention blocks are a type of neural network architecture that are used to transform a state according to an attention operation and a feedforward network. These blocks are similar to Transformer blocks, which are commonly used in natural language processing.

In geometric attention blocks, the attention operation is performed using a geometric multi-head attention (geometric_mha) function. This function takes in a set of input vectors and calculates a set of attention scores, which are then used to weight the input vectors and produce a new set of output vectors.

The output of the geometric_mha function is then passed through a SwiGLU MLP, which is a type of feedforward network that is designed to be computationally efficient. The SwiGLU MLP takes in the output of the geometric_mha function and produces a new set of output vectors.

In the context of this video, we are interested in using geometric attention blocks to learn a single token, or a single latent variable, per residue. To do this, we take the embedding corresponding to the query residue position $N_{:, 0,:}$. This embedding represents the input vector for the geometric_mha function, and the output of the function is used to weight the input vector and produce a new set of output vectors.

Overall, geometric attention blocks are a powerful tool for transforming input data and learning latent variables in machine learning models. By using these blocks, we can improve the accuracy and efficiency of our models and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying data.

The process of generating structure tokens (Algorithm 7) from the full 3D coordinates of the protein then is as follows:
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the process of generating structure tokens from the full 3D coordinates of a protein. This is a crucial step in the field of protein structure prediction and analysis.

To begin, let's define some key terms. Protein structure prediction is the process of determining the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. Protein structure analysis is the study of the structure and function of proteins.

Now, let's dive into Algorithm 7, which is the process of generating structure tokens. Structure tokens are essentially a simplified representation of the 3D structure of a protein. They are generated by first obtaining the full 3D coordinates of the protein, which can be done using techniques such as X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy.

Once the full 3D coordinates are obtained, the protein is divided into smaller segments called residues. Each residue is then represented by a set of structure tokens, which are essentially a set of numerical values that describe the position and orientation of the residue in 3D space.

The process of generating structure tokens involves several steps, including normalization, rotation, and translation. Normalization is the process of scaling the coordinates of each residue so that they are all within a certain range. Rotation is the process of rotating each residue so that it is aligned with a standard coordinate system. Translation is the process of shifting each residue so that it is centered at the origin of the coordinate system.

Once these steps are completed, the structure tokens for each residue are combined to form a complete set of structure tokens for the entire protein. These structure tokens can then be used for a variety of applications, such as protein structure prediction, protein-protein interaction prediction, and drug discovery.

In summary, the process of generating structure tokens from the full 3D coordinates of a protein involves dividing the protein into residues, normalizing the coordinates, rotating and translating each residue, and combining the structure tokens to form a complete set. This process is a crucial step in the field of protein structure prediction and analysis, and has many important applications in the field of biochemistry and molecular biology.

1. Local Neighborhood: For each residue, obtain the indices $N_{\text {idx }} \in\{0 . . L-1\}^{L \times 16}$ of the 16 nearest residues (as measured by $C_{\alpha}$ distance). The first of the 16 neighbors is always the residue itself. We also obtain the frames for each residue in a local neighborhood with $T_{\text {knn }}$.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference to experts in the field of protein structure analysis. Specifically, we will be discussing the concept of a local neighborhood and how it is used to obtain the indices of the 16 nearest residues to a given residue.

First, let's define what we mean by a local neighborhood. In the context of protein structure analysis, a local neighborhood refers to the set of residues that are in close proximity to a given residue. This is important because the interactions between residues in a protein are what give it its unique structure and function.

To obtain the indices of the 16 nearest residues to a given residue, we use a technique called $C_{\alpha}$ distance. This is a measure of the distance between two residues based on the position of their $C_{\alpha}$ atoms. The $C_{\alpha}$ atom is a carbon atom in the backbone of the amino acid chain that is closest to the side chain.

Once we have obtained the $C_{\alpha}$ distances between the given residue and all other residues in the protein, we can identify the 16 nearest residues. The first of these 16 neighbors is always the residue itself.

In addition to obtaining the indices of the 16 nearest residues, we also obtain the frames for each residue in the local neighborhood with $T_{\text {knn }}$. This refers to the time frames in which the nearest neighbors are located. This information is important for understanding the dynamics of the protein and how it changes over time.

In summary, a local neighborhood is a set of residues that are in close proximity to a given residue in a protein. To obtain the indices of the 16 nearest residues, we use $C_{\alpha}$ distance and also obtain the frames for each residue in the local neighborhood with $T_{\text {knn }}$. This information is crucial for understanding the structure and function of proteins. Thank you for watching!###

------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of Embed Neighbors. This is a term used in the field of machine learning, specifically in the context of sequence modeling.

In sequence modeling, we are interested in predicting the next element in a sequence given the previous elements. For example, in natural language processing, we might want to predict the next word in a sentence given the previous words.

Embed Neighbors is a technique used to improve the accuracy of these predictions. It involves embedding the relative distance in sequence space for each neighbor.

Let's break down what this means. First, we need to understand what embedding is. Embedding is the process of converting a high-dimensional vector into a lower-dimensional vector while preserving its meaning. In the context of sequence modeling, we can embed each element in the sequence into a lower-dimensional vector.

Now, let's talk about neighbors. In sequence modeling, we can define neighbors as the elements in the sequence that are close to the element we want to predict. For example, in a sentence, the neighbors of a word might be the words that come before and after it.

To embed the neighbors, we first calculate the relative distance in sequence space for each neighbor. This is done by subtracting the index of the neighbor from the index of the element we want to predict. We then clamp this value to be between -32 and 32 to ensure that it is within a reasonable range.

Finally, we embed the clamped relative distance into a lower-dimensional vector using the same embedding matrix that we used for the elements in the sequence. This gives us a new matrix called N, which contains the embedded neighbors for each element in the sequence.

In summary, Embed Neighbors is a technique used in sequence modeling to improve the accuracy of predictions by embedding the relative distance in sequence space for each neighbor. This involves calculating the relative distance, clamping it to a reasonable range, and embedding it into a lower-dimensional vector using the same embedding matrix as the elements in the sequence.

3. Encode: Pass $N$ through a shallow encoder $f_{\text {enc }}$ consisting of 2 Transformer blocks, with regular multihead self-attention swapped with geometric_mha. The attention is unmasked, all-to-all over the entire neighborhood.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference to experts in the field of natural language processing. Specifically, we will be looking at the process of encoding and how it relates to the use of a shallow encoder.

First, let's define what we mean by encoding. Encoding is the process of converting a piece of text into a numerical representation that can be used by a machine learning model. This is typically done using a neural network, which is trained to map the text to a vector space.

Now, let's talk about the specific encoding process mentioned in the reference. The text is passed through a shallow encoder, which consists of two Transformer blocks. A Transformer block is a type of neural network architecture that was introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Google in 2017. It is designed to handle sequential data, such as text, and is particularly effective at capturing long-range dependencies.

The attention mechanism used in the Transformer block is called geometric_mha, which stands for geometric multihead attention. This is a variant of the standard multihead attention mechanism, which allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence in a more flexible way.

Finally, the attention is unmasked and all-to-all over the entire neighborhood. This means that the model is able to attend to all parts of the input sequence, without any restrictions.

In summary, the encoding process mentioned in the reference involves passing text through a shallow encoder consisting of two Transformer blocks with geometric_mha attention. The attention is unmasked and all-to-all over the entire neighborhood. This allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and attend to all parts of the input sequence.

4. Quantize: Extract the first element $N_{:, 0,:}$ from the neighborhood, which corresponds to the residue itself. Project it linearly, and quantize by replacing with the nearest vector in a codebook. This yields the structure token per residue.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on quantization in the field of signal processing. In this video, we will be discussing the process of quantization and how it is used to extract information from signals.

Quantization is the process of approximating a continuous signal with a discrete set of values. This is done by dividing the signal into a finite number of levels, each of which is represented by a unique symbol. The process of quantization involves two main steps: sampling and encoding.

Sampling is the process of taking measurements of the signal at regular intervals. This is done by dividing the signal into a series of time intervals, and measuring the value of the signal at the beginning of each interval. The resulting set of measurements is called a sample.

Encoding is the process of assigning a unique symbol to each sample. This is done by dividing the range of possible signal values into a finite number of levels, and assigning a unique symbol to each level. The symbols are typically represented by binary digits, or bits.

Now, let's take a look at the specific example given in the prompt. The first step is to extract the first element $N_{:, 0,:}$ from the neighborhood. This element corresponds to the residue itself.

Next, we project this element linearly. This means that we apply a linear transformation to the element, which maps it to a new vector in a lower-dimensional space. The goal of this projection is to reduce the dimensionality of the data, while preserving as much information as possible.

Finally, we quantize the projected element by replacing it with the nearest vector in a codebook. A codebook is a set of vectors that are used to represent the possible values of the signal. The nearest vector in the codebook is chosen based on a distance metric, such as Euclidean distance.

The result of this process is the structure token per residue. This token represents the quantized value of the residue, and can be used to extract information about the structure of the signal.

In summary, quantization is a process used in signal processing to approximate a continuous signal with a discrete set of values. This is done by sampling the signal, encoding the samples, and projecting them linearly. The resulting quantized values can be used to extract information about the structure of the signal.

------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing Algorithm 7 structure_encode. This algorithm is used for encoding the structure of a protein in a way that can be easily understood by a computer.

Let's start by breaking down the input parameters. The first parameter is $x_{C_{\alpha}} \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times 3}$. This is a matrix that represents the coordinates of the alpha carbon atoms in the protein. The second parameter is $T \in S E(3)^{L}$, which is a matrix that represents the transformation of the protein.

The first step of the algorithm is to find the nearest neighbors of each alpha carbon atom. This is done using the knn function, which stands for k-nearest neighbors. The output of this step is a matrix $N_{\mathrm{idx}}=\operatorname{knn}\left(x_{C_{\alpha}}\right) \quad \triangleright\{0 . . L-1\}^{L \times 16}$. This matrix contains the indices of the 16 nearest neighbors of each alpha carbon atom.

The next step is to find the coordinates of the nearest neighbors. This is done using the T matrix, which is indexed by the nearest neighbor indices. The output of this step is a matrix $T_{\mathrm{knn}}=T\left[N_{\mathrm{idx}}\right] \quad \triangleright S E(3)^{L \times 16}$.

The next step is to calculate the difference between the coordinates of each alpha carbon atom and its nearest neighbors. This is done using the clamp function, which limits the difference to a range of -32 to 32. The output of this step is a matrix $\Delta i=\operatorname{clamp}\left(N_{\mathrm{idx}}-i,-32,32\right)$.

The next step is to embed the difference matrix into a higher dimensional space. This is done using the embed function, which outputs a matrix $N=\operatorname{embed}(\Delta i)$.

The next step is to calculate the difference between the embedded matrix and the original matrix. This is done using the Delta function, which outputs a matrix $\Delta \mathbb{R}^{L \times 16 \times d}$.

The next step is to encode the structure of the protein using a neural network. This is done using the f_enc function, which takes as input the difference matrix and the nearest neighbor coordinates. The output of this step is a matrix $N=f_{\text {enc }}\left(N, T_{\mathrm{knn}}\right)$ in the higher dimensional space.

The final step is to quantize the encoded structure into a lower dimensional space. This is done using the Linear function, which outputs a matrix $z=\operatorname{Linear}\left(N_{:, 0,:}\right) \quad \triangleright \mathbb{R}^{L \times d^{\prime}}$. The output of this step is then quantized into a range of 0 to 4095.

In summary, Algorithm 7 structure_encode is a powerful tool for encoding the structure of a protein in a way that can be easily understood by a computer. It involves finding the nearest neighbors of each alpha carbon atom, calculating the difference between the coordinates, embedding the difference matrix into a higher dimensional space, encoding the structure using a neural network, and finally quantizing the encoded structure into a lower dimensional space.

quantize transforms the $L$ latents into $L$ discrete tokens. Since the VQ-VAE was initially proposed (67), numerous approaches and tricks have been developed to address issues with poor codebook utilization and unstable training. We chose to learn the codebook as an exponential moving average of encoder outputs (67-69). To improve codebook utilization, unused codes are re-initialized to encoder outputs.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of quantization in the context of VQ-VAE.

First, let's define some terms. VQ-VAE stands for Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder. This is a type of neural network that is used for unsupervised learning tasks such as image generation and compression.

Now, let's talk about quantization. Quantization is the process of converting continuous values into discrete values. In the context of VQ-VAE, quantization is used to transform the $L$ latents into $L$ discrete tokens.

Latents are the internal representations of the input data that are learned by the encoder network. These latents are typically high-dimensional and continuous. However, in order to use them for tasks such as image generation, we need to convert them into discrete tokens.

This is where quantization comes in. By quantizing the latents, we can represent them as a set of discrete tokens. This makes it easier to manipulate and use the latents for tasks such as image generation.

Now, let's talk about some of the challenges with quantization in VQ-VAE. One issue is poor codebook utilization. The codebook is a set of discrete tokens that are used to represent the latents. If the codebook is not utilized effectively, it can lead to poor performance.

To address this issue, numerous approaches and tricks have been developed. One approach is to learn the codebook as an exponential moving average of encoder outputs. This means that the codebook is updated based on the outputs of the encoder network.

Another trick is to re-initialize unused codes to encoder outputs. This helps to improve codebook utilization by ensuring that all codes are being used effectively.

In summary, quantization is the process of converting continuous values into discrete values. In the context of VQ-VAE, quantization is used to transform the latents into discrete tokens. To address issues with poor codebook utilization and unstable training, various approaches and tricks have been developed, such as learning the codebook as an exponential moving average of encoder outputs and re-initializing unused codes to encoder outputs.

To improve training and inference efficiency, we encode all local structure graphs within a protein in parallel. In practice, this means that given a batch of $B$ proteins with average sequence length $L$, then the inputs to the structure encoder will have shape $B L \times 16 \times d$.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference to experts on improving training and inference efficiency in the field of protein structure prediction.

In this reference, the authors propose a method to encode all local structure graphs within a protein in parallel. This means that instead of processing each local structure graph separately, they are processed simultaneously, which can significantly improve the efficiency of training and inference.

To understand this concept better, let's break down some of the terms used in the reference.

First, let's define what a local structure graph is. A local structure graph is a representation of the 3D structure of a protein, where each node represents an amino acid and each edge represents a connection between two amino acids.

Next, let's talk about batch processing. In machine learning, batch processing refers to the process of processing multiple samples or instances at once. In this reference, the authors are processing a batch of $B$ proteins, where $B$ represents the number of proteins in the batch.

The average sequence length $L$ refers to the average number of amino acids in each protein in the batch. This is an important factor to consider because the inputs to the structure encoder will have a shape of $B L \times 16 \times d$, where $d$ represents the dimensionality of the input features.

Finally, let's talk about the structure encoder. The structure encoder is a neural network that takes as input the local structure graphs of each protein in the batch and encodes them into a fixed-length vector representation. This vector representation can then be used for downstream tasks such as protein structure prediction.

In summary, the authors propose a method to encode all local structure graphs within a protein in parallel, which can significantly improve the efficiency of training and inference in protein structure prediction. By processing a batch of proteins simultaneously and using a structure encoder to encode the local structure graphs, they are able to achieve state-of-the-art results in protein structure prediction.

While the encoder independently processes all local structures in parallel, the decoder $f_{\text {dec }}$ attends over the entire set of $L$ tokens to reconstruct the full structure. It is composed using a stack of bidirectional Transformer blocks with regular self-attention.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference to experts in the field of natural language processing. Specifically, we will be looking at the use of a decoder in a Transformer model.

In this context, a decoder is a component of a Transformer model that is responsible for generating the output sequence from the input sequence. It does this by attending over the entire set of input tokens to reconstruct the full structure.

The decoder is composed of a stack of bidirectional Transformer blocks with regular self-attention. This means that the decoder is able to process the input sequence in both directions, allowing it to capture long-range dependencies between tokens.

The self-attention mechanism allows the decoder to attend to different parts of the input sequence, giving it the ability to generate the output sequence in a way that is contextually relevant.

Overall, the use of a decoder in a Transformer model is an important component in the field of natural language processing, allowing for the generation of high-quality output sequences from input sequences.

Thank you for watching, and we hope this explanation has been helpful in understanding this reference to experts.

As discussed in Appendix A.1.7.3, the VQ-VAE is trained in two stages. In the first stage, a smaller decoder trunk consisting of 8 Transformer blocks with width 1024, rotary positional embeddings, and MLPs is trained to only predict backbone coordinates. In the second stage, the decoder weights are re-initialized and the network size is expanded to 30 layers, each with an embedding dimension of 1280 ( $\sim 600 \mathrm{M}$ parameters) to predict all atom coordinates.

The exact steps to convert structure tokens back to 3D allatom coordinates using the decoder is provided in Algorithm 8 and detailed as follows,
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the process of converting structure tokens back to 3D allatom coordinates using the decoder. This process is outlined in Algorithm 8 and we will be going through each step in detail.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those not specializing in this field. Structure tokens are a representation of a protein structure that is used in the process of protein folding prediction. Allatom coordinates refer to the precise 3D coordinates of each atom in a protein structure.

Now, let's dive into the steps of the algorithm. The first step is to initialize the decoder with the structure tokens. This means that we are providing the decoder with the representation of the protein structure that we want to convert back into 3D allatom coordinates.

The next step is to use the decoder to generate a set of allatom coordinates. This is done by running the decoder on the structure tokens and allowing it to generate the corresponding 3D coordinates for each atom in the protein structure.

Once the allatom coordinates have been generated, we need to refine them to ensure that they are accurate and precise. This is done by running a refinement algorithm on the coordinates. The refinement algorithm takes into account the physical properties of the protein structure and makes adjustments to the coordinates to ensure that they are as accurate as possible.

Finally, we need to evaluate the quality of the allatom coordinates that have been generated. This is done by comparing them to the original 3D coordinates of the protein structure. If the generated coordinates are accurate and precise, then the process is complete. If not, we may need to refine the coordinates further or adjust the parameters of the decoder to improve the accuracy of the results.

In summary, the process of converting structure tokens back to 3D allatom coordinates using the decoder involves initializing the decoder with the structure tokens, generating allatom coordinates, refining the coordinates, and evaluating the quality of the results. By following these steps, we can accurately and precisely convert protein structure representations back into 3D allatom coordinates.

1. Transformer: We embed the structure tokens and pass them through a stack of Transformer blocks $f_{d e c}$ (regular self-attention + MLP sublayers, no geometric attention).
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the use of Transformers in the field of natural language processing.

First, let's define what a Transformer is. A Transformer is a type of neural network architecture that was introduced in 2017 by researchers at Google. It is designed to process sequential data, such as text, and has been shown to be particularly effective in tasks such as machine translation and language modeling.

Now, let's break down the specific terms used in the statement: "We embed the structure tokens and pass them through a stack of Transformer blocks $f_{d e c}$ (regular self-attention + MLP sublayers, no geometric attention)."

- Embedding: This refers to the process of converting a high-dimensional input, such as a word or phrase, into a lower-dimensional vector representation that can be processed by a neural network.

- Structure tokens: These are tokens that represent the structure of the input data, such as sentence boundaries or paragraph breaks.

- Transformer blocks: These are the building blocks of a Transformer network. Each block consists of two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention layer and a feed-forward neural network layer.

- Self-attention: This is a mechanism that allows the network to focus on different parts of the input data. It works by computing a set of attention weights that determine how much attention should be paid to each part of the input.

- MLP sublayers: These are fully connected neural network layers that are used to transform the input data.

- Geometric attention: This is a type of attention mechanism that takes into account the spatial relationships between different parts of the input data. In this case, the statement specifies that no geometric attention is used.

So, to summarize, the statement is describing a process where input data is first embedded into a lower-dimensional representation, and then passed through a series of Transformer blocks that use self-attention and MLP sublayers to process the data. The use of structure tokens and the absence of geometric attention are specific details of this particular implementation.

I hope this explanation has been helpful in understanding the use of Transformers in natural language processing. Thank you for watching!###

2. Projection Head: We use a projection head to regress 3 3-D vectors per residue: a translation vector $\vec{t}$, and 2 vectors $-\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ that define the $N-C_{\alpha}-C$ plane per residue after it has been rotated into position. This head also predicts the unnormalized sine and cosine components of up to 7 sidechain torsion angles.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of a projection head in the field of protein structure prediction.

First, let's define what we mean by a projection head. A projection head is a mathematical tool used to regress 3-D vectors per residue. These vectors are used to define the position and orientation of each amino acid in a protein structure.

Now, let's break down the three types of vectors that are regressed by the projection head. The first is a translation vector, denoted by $\vec{t}$. This vector represents the position of the amino acid in 3-D space.

The second and third vectors are $-\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$, respectively. These vectors define the $N-C_{\alpha}-C$ plane per residue after it has been rotated into position. The $N-C_{\alpha}-C$ plane is a plane that passes through the nitrogen, carbon alpha, and carbon atoms of an amino acid. It is used as a reference plane for defining the orientation of the amino acid.

Finally, the projection head also predicts the unnormalized sine and cosine components of up to 7 sidechain torsion angles. Sidechain torsion angles are angles formed between the atoms in the sidechain of an amino acid. These angles are important for determining the overall structure and function of a protein.

In summary, a projection head is a mathematical tool used to regress 3-D vectors per residue, including a translation vector, two vectors that define the $N-C_{\alpha}-C$ plane, and up to 7 sidechain torsion angles. Understanding these concepts is important for accurately predicting protein structures and their functions. Thank you for watching!###

3. Calculate $T$ : We use gram_schmidt to convert $\vec{t}$, $\vec{x}$, and $\vec{y}$ into frames $T \in S E(3)^{L}$.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on how to calculate $T$ using the gram_schmidt method. In this video, we will be discussing the gram_schmidt method and how it can be used to convert vectors into frames.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those who are not familiar with this field. $S E(3)^{L}$ is a special Euclidean group, which is a group of transformations that preserve the Euclidean distance between points in a three-dimensional space. A frame is a set of three orthonormal vectors that span the three-dimensional space.

Now, let's move on to the gram_schmidt method. This method is used to convert a set of vectors into an orthonormal basis. In this case, we will be using it to convert $\vec{t}$, $\vec{x}$, and $\vec{y}$ into frames $T \in S E(3)^{L}$.

To do this, we first need to find the orthonormal basis for the space spanned by $\vec{t}$, $\vec{x}$, and $\vec{y}$. We can do this by finding the first vector in the basis, which is $\vec{t}$. We then find the second vector in the basis by subtracting the projection of $\vec{x}$ onto $\vec{t}$ from $\vec{x}$. This gives us the vector $\vec{v}$. We then normalize $\vec{v}$ to get the second vector in the basis, which is $\vec{u}$.

Finally, we find the third vector in the basis by subtracting the projection of $\vec{y}$ onto $\vec{u}$ from $\vec{y}$. This gives us the vector $\vec{w}$. We then normalize $\vec{w}$ to get the third vector in the basis, which is $\vec{n}$.

Now that we have our orthonormal basis, we can use it to create our frame $T \in S E(3)^{L}$. We do this by taking the matrix $T = [\vec{t} \vec{u} \vec{n}]$. This matrix represents the transformation that takes the standard basis vectors $\vec{i}$, $\vec{j}$, and $\vec{k}$ to the basis vectors $\vec{t}$, $\vec{u}$, and $\vec{n}$.

And that's it! By using the gram_schmidt method, we were able to convert $\vec{t}$, $\vec{x}$, and $\vec{y}$ into frames $T \in S E(3)^{L}$. Thank you for watching, and we hope this video was helpful!###

4. Calculate $T_{\text {local }}$ : We normalize the sine and cosine components and convert them to frames $T_{\text {local }} \in$ $S E(3)^{L \times 7}$ corresponding to rotations around the previous element on the sidechain.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on how to calculate $T_{\text {local }}$ in the field of molecular dynamics simulations. In this video, we will be discussing the process of normalizing the sine and cosine components and converting them to frames $T_{\text {local }} \in$ $S E(3)^{L \times 7}$ corresponding to rotations around the previous element on the sidechain.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those not specializing in this field. $T_{\text {local }}$ refers to the local coordinate system of a particular atom in a molecule. This coordinate system is defined by the position and orientation of the atom relative to its neighboring atoms.

The sine and cosine components refer to the sine and cosine of the angle between the local coordinate system of the current atom and the local coordinate system of the previous atom in the sidechain. These components are used to calculate the rotation matrix that transforms the local coordinate system of the previous atom to the local coordinate system of the current atom.

Normalizing the sine and cosine components means dividing them by their magnitudes to ensure that the resulting rotation matrix has a unit determinant. This is important for ensuring that the rotation matrix is valid and does not cause any numerical instability in the simulation.

Finally, converting the normalized sine and cosine components to frames $T_{\text {local }} \in$ $S E(3)^{L \times 7}$ corresponding to rotations around the previous element on the sidechain means creating a matrix that represents the rotation of the local coordinate system of the current atom relative to the local coordinate system of the previous atom. This matrix is used in the molecular dynamics simulation to calculate the forces and energies of the system.

In summary, calculating $T_{\text {local }}$ involves normalizing the sine and cosine components of the angle between the local coordinate systems of neighboring atoms and converting them to a matrix that represents the rotation of the local coordinate system of the current atom relative to the local coordinate system of the previous atom. This process is important for accurately simulating the behavior of molecules in molecular dynamics simulations.

5. Compose Frames: We compose each element of $T_{\text {local }}$ with its predecessors on a tree rooted at $T$ to form $T_{\text {global }} \in S E(3)^{L \times 14}$, corresponding to the transformations needed for each heavy atom per residue in atom14 representation.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the process of composing frames in the field of structural biology.

In order to understand this concept, we first need to define a few key terms. "T_local" refers to the local transformation matrix for each heavy atom in a protein structure. This matrix describes the rotation and translation of the atom relative to its parent atom.

"T_global" is the global transformation matrix for each heavy atom in the protein structure. This matrix describes the transformation needed for each heavy atom per residue in the atom14 representation.

Now, let's dive into the process of composing frames. We start by taking each element of T_local and combining it with its predecessors on a tree rooted at T. This creates a new matrix, T_global, which contains the transformations needed for each heavy atom per residue in the atom14 representation.

This process is important because it allows us to accurately model the movement and interactions of atoms within a protein structure. By understanding how each atom moves and interacts with its surroundings, we can gain insights into the function and behavior of the protein.

In summary, composing frames is a crucial step in the analysis of protein structures. By combining local transformation matrices into a global transformation matrix, we can accurately model the movement and interactions of atoms within a protein structure.

6. Apply Frames: We then apply the frame to the $\overrightarrow{X_{\text {ref }}} \in$ $\mathbb{R}^{L \times 14 \times 3}$ coordinates in a reference frame, to rotate and transform each residue into their final positions.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on applying frames in the field of molecular dynamics simulations. In this video, we will be discussing the process of applying frames to the coordinates of a reference frame in order to rotate and transform each residue into their final positions.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those not specializing in this field. A residue is a specific group of atoms within a protein or other biomolecule. In molecular dynamics simulations, we use coordinates to represent the positions of these atoms in space.

Now, let's talk about frames. A frame is a set of axes that we use to define the orientation of our reference system. In molecular dynamics simulations, we often use Cartesian coordinates to represent the positions of atoms in space. However, these coordinates are relative to a specific frame of reference.

To apply frames, we first need to define the coordinates of our reference frame. In this case, we are using a reference frame with coordinates $\overrightarrow{X_{\text {ref }}} \in$ $\mathbb{R}^{L \times 14 \times 3}$. This means that we have a set of coordinates for each atom in our system, where L is the number of atoms, 14 is the number of atoms in each residue, and 3 represents the three dimensions of space.

Once we have our reference frame coordinates, we can apply frames to rotate and transform each residue into their final positions. This involves using mathematical operations to manipulate the coordinates of each atom in the system.

In summary, applying frames is a crucial step in molecular dynamics simulations that involves using a reference frame to define the orientation of our system and then using mathematical operations to rotate and transform each residue into their final positions. Thank you for watching, and we hope this video has been helpful in explaining this concept to experts in the field.###

The first step of the algorithm is to embed the input $z$, which is a $L \times 16$ matrix of values between 0 and 4099. Embedding is a process of converting the input into a higher dimensional space, which helps in better representation of the data.

The next step is to pass the embedded input through a function $f_{d e c}$. This function is responsible for decoding the structure of the input and producing a $L \times d$ matrix, where d is the dimensionality of the output space.

The third step involves projecting the output of the previous step onto a 3D space, which results in a $L \times 3$ matrix representing the translation vector, and a $L \times 7$ matrix representing the rotation matrix.

The fourth step involves computing the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization of the translation vector and the rotation matrix, which results in a $L \times 3$ matrix representing the translation vector and a $L \times 7$ matrix representing the rotation matrix.

The fifth step involves computing the sine of the angle between the translation vector and the rotation matrix, which is used in the next step.

The sixth step involves computing the cosine of the angle between the translation vector and the rotation matrix, which is used in the next step.

The seventh step involves computing the local rotation matrix using the sine and cosine values computed in the previous steps.

The eighth step involves computing the global rotation matrix by combining the local rotation matrix and the rotation matrix computed in the third step.

The final step involves computing the 3D coordinates of the input using the global rotation matrix and the reference 3D coordinates.

In summary, Algorithm 8 structure_decode involves embedding the input, decoding the structure, projecting onto a 3D space, computing the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization, computing the sine and cosine values, computing the local and global rotation matrices, and finally computing the 3D coordinates of the input.

When using a VQ-VAE to learn discrete representations which maximize reconstruction quality, it is common to train in the autoencoder in two stages (70). In the first stage, the encoder and codebook is learned with a relatively small and efficient decoder. In the second stage, the encoder and codebook are frozen and a larger or otherwise more computationally expensive decoder is trained to maximize reconstruction quality. We follow this two-stage training approach for the structure tokenizer.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on using a VQ-VAE to learn discrete representations for maximizing reconstruction quality. In this video, we will be discussing the two-stage training approach for the structure tokenizer.

First, let's define some terms. VQ-VAE stands for Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder. This is a type of neural network that is used for unsupervised learning of discrete representations. Autoencoder refers to a neural network that is used for unsupervised learning of efficient data codings.

Now, let's talk about the two-stage training approach. In the first stage, the encoder and codebook are learned with a relatively small and efficient decoder. The encoder is responsible for encoding the input data into a compressed representation, while the codebook is used to store the compressed representations. The decoder is used to reconstruct the input data from the compressed representation.

In the second stage, the encoder and codebook are frozen and a larger or otherwise more computationally expensive decoder is trained to maximize reconstruction quality. This means that the encoder and codebook are no longer being updated during training, and instead, the focus is on improving the decoder to produce better reconstructions of the input data.

Finally, we follow this two-stage training approach for the structure tokenizer. The structure tokenizer is a specific type of VQ-VAE that is used for learning discrete representations of structured data, such as images or text.

In summary, the two-stage training approach for the structure tokenizer involves first learning the encoder and codebook with a small decoder, and then freezing the encoder and codebook and training a larger decoder to maximize reconstruction quality. This approach is commonly used in VQ-VAE models for unsupervised learning of discrete representations.

The VQ-VAE is trained for $90 \mathrm{k}$ steps on a dataset of single chain proteins from the PDB, AFDB, and ESMAtlas. We use the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov et al. 2017) with learning rate annealed from $4 \mathrm{e}-4$ according to a cosine decay schedule. Proteins are cropped to a maximum sequence length of 512. Five losses are used to supervise this stage of training. The geometric distance and geometric direction losses are responsible for supervising reconstruction of high quality backbone structures.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the VQ-VAE model and its training process. The VQ-VAE model is a type of neural network that is used for unsupervised learning of representations of data. In this case, the data we are working with is a dataset of single chain proteins from the PDB, AFDB, and ESMAtlas.

The VQ-VAE model is trained for $90 \mathrm{k}$ steps, which means that the model is trained for 90,000 iterations. During each iteration, the model is updated based on the data it is being trained on.

The AdamW optimizer is used during the training process. This is a type of optimizer that is used to update the parameters of the model during training. The learning rate is annealed from $4 \mathrm{e}-4$ according to a cosine decay schedule. This means that the learning rate starts at $4 \mathrm{e}-4$ and gradually decreases over time.

Proteins are cropped to a maximum sequence length of 512. This means that the proteins are divided into smaller segments of 512 amino acids each. This is done to make the training process more efficient.

Five losses are used to supervise this stage of training. The geometric distance and geometric direction losses are responsible for supervising reconstruction of high quality backbone structures. These losses are used to ensure that the model is accurately representing the data it is being trained on.

In summary, the VQ-VAE model is trained on a dataset of single chain proteins using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate annealed from $4 \mathrm{e}-4$ according to a cosine decay schedule. Proteins are cropped to a maximum sequence length of 512 and five losses are used to supervise the training process.

Additionally, a distogram and binned direction classification loss are used to bootstrap structure prediction but are ultimately immaterial to reconstruction. We have found that these structure prediction losses formulated as classification tasks improve convergence early in training. To produce these pairwise logits, we use a pairwise_proj_head, that takes $x \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times d}$ and returns logits $z \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times L \times d^{\prime}}$. It works as follows:
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference to experts in the field of machine learning. In this reference, the authors have used a distogram and binned direction classification loss to bootstrap structure prediction.

Let's start by defining what a distogram is. A distogram is a histogram of pairwise distances between data points. It is used to visualize the distribution of distances between data points in a dataset.

Next, let's define what a binned direction classification loss is. This is a loss function that is used to classify the direction of a pair of data points. The direction is binned into a finite number of classes, and the loss function is used to classify the direction of a pair of data points into one of these classes.

Now, let's talk about how these two concepts are used in the reference. The authors have used a distogram and binned direction classification loss to bootstrap structure prediction. This means that they have used these two concepts to help predict the structure of the data.

The authors have also used a pairwise_proj_head to produce pairwise logits. This is a function that takes in a matrix of data points and returns a matrix of logits. The logits represent the probability of a pair of data points belonging to a certain class.

In summary, the authors have used a distogram and binned direction classification loss to bootstrap structure prediction, and a pairwise_proj_head to produce pairwise logits. These concepts are used to help predict the structure of the data and improve convergence early in training.

------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing Algorithm 9, also known as the pairwise projection algorithm. This algorithm is commonly used in the field of machine learning and is particularly useful for tasks such as dimensionality reduction and data visualization.

Let's start by breaking down the input parameters of the algorithm. The first parameter is $x$, which is a matrix of size $L \times d$. This matrix represents the data that we want to project onto a lower-dimensional space.

The next two parameters, $q$ and $k$, are projections of the input matrix $x$. These projections are calculated using a technique called the projection operator, which is denoted by $\operatorname{proj}$. The projection operator is used to find the best approximation of a vector in a lower-dimensional space.

The fourth parameter is a matrix of size $L \times L \times d'$, where $d'$ is the dimensionality of the projected space. This matrix is calculated using the dot product and subtraction operations on the projections $q$ and $k$.

Finally, the algorithm returns a matrix $z$ of size $L \times L \times d'$, which represents the projection of the input data onto the lower-dimensional space.

In summary, Algorithm 9 is a powerful tool for dimensionality reduction and data visualization. It takes as input a matrix of data, calculates projections of the data onto a lower-dimensional space, and returns a matrix representing the projection of the data onto that space.

Finally, an inverse folding token prediction loss (i.e., a crossentropy loss between predicted sequence and ground truth sequence) is an auxiliary loss used to encourage the learned representations to contain information pertinent to sequencerelated tasks.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of inverse folding token prediction loss. This is a technique used in the field of machine learning, specifically in sequence-related tasks.

Let's break down the term "inverse folding token prediction loss". The word "inverse" refers to the fact that the loss function is calculated in the opposite direction of the usual forward pass of a neural network. "Folding" refers to the process of collapsing a sequence into a single vector representation. "Token" refers to a single element in a sequence, such as a word in a sentence. "Prediction" refers to the process of predicting the next token in a sequence. "Loss" refers to the difference between the predicted output and the ground truth output.

So, what does all of this mean? Essentially, inverse folding token prediction loss is a way to encourage a neural network to learn representations that are useful for sequence-related tasks. This is done by calculating a loss function that compares the predicted sequence to the ground truth sequence. By minimizing this loss function, the neural network is forced to learn representations that contain information relevant to the task at hand.

In summary, inverse folding token prediction loss is a technique used in machine learning to improve the performance of sequence-related tasks. It involves calculating a loss function that compares the predicted sequence to the ground truth sequence, and using this loss function to encourage the neural network to learn useful representations.

The five losses are covered in detailed as follows:
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the five losses in detail. These losses are important concepts in the field of thermodynamics and are crucial for understanding the efficiency of energy conversion processes.

The first loss is known as the sensible heat loss. This refers to the heat that is lost due to a temperature difference between the hot and cold sides of a system. For example, when you heat up a pot of water on a stove, some of the heat is lost to the air around the pot, which is at a lower temperature.

The second loss is the latent heat loss. This occurs when a substance changes phase, such as when water evaporates or when ice melts. During this process, energy is required to break the bonds between the molecules, and this energy is lost as heat.

The third loss is the chemical reaction loss. This occurs when a chemical reaction takes place during an energy conversion process. For example, when you burn fuel in a car engine, some of the energy is lost as heat due to the chemical reaction between the fuel and oxygen.

The fourth loss is the friction loss. This occurs when there is resistance to the flow of a fluid or gas, such as when air flows over the surface of an airplane wing. The friction between the air and the wing causes some of the energy to be lost as heat.

Finally, the fifth loss is the radiation loss. This occurs when heat is lost due to the emission of electromagnetic radiation, such as when a hot object emits infrared radiation.

In summary, the five losses are important concepts in thermodynamics that help us understand the efficiency of energy conversion processes. By minimizing these losses, we can improve the efficiency of our energy systems and reduce our impact on the environment. Thank you for watching!###

1. Backbone Distance Loss: Compute the pairwise $L_{2}$ distance matrix for the predicted and true coordinates of the 3 backbone atoms $\left(N, C_{\alpha}, C\right.$ ). Let $D_{\text {pred }}, D \in$ $\mathbb{R}^{3 L \times 3 L}$. Compute $\left(D_{\text {pred }}-D\right)^{2}$, clamp the maximum error to $(5 \AA)^{2}$, and take the mean.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of Backbone Distance Loss. This is a term that is commonly used in the field of protein structure prediction, and it is an important metric for evaluating the accuracy of predicted protein structures.

To understand what Backbone Distance Loss means, we first need to define some key terms. The backbone of a protein refers to the chain of amino acids that make up the protein's structure. The backbone is made up of three atoms: nitrogen (N), carbon alpha (Cα), and carbon (C). These three atoms are connected by chemical bonds, and they form the backbone of the protein.

Now, let's talk about the term "distance matrix". A distance matrix is a table that shows the distances between all pairs of atoms in a protein structure. In this case, we are interested in the distances between the three backbone atoms: N, Cα, and C.

To compute the Backbone Distance Loss, we first need to predict the coordinates of the three backbone atoms using a protein structure prediction algorithm. We then compare these predicted coordinates to the true coordinates of the backbone atoms, which are known from experimental data.

To do this comparison, we compute the pairwise L2 distance matrix for the predicted and true coordinates of the three backbone atoms. The L2 distance is a measure of the straight-line distance between two points in a 3D space. We compute the L2 distance between all pairs of atoms in the predicted and true structures, and we store the results in two matrices: D_pred and D.

Next, we compute the difference between the predicted and true distance matrices: (D_pred - D)^2. This gives us a matrix of squared differences between the predicted and true distances.

To prevent the loss from being dominated by a few outliers, we clamp the maximum error to (5 Å)^2. This means that any squared difference greater than (5 Å)^2 is set to (5 Å)^2.

Finally, we take the mean of the squared differences to get the Backbone Distance Loss. This gives us a single number that represents the overall accuracy of the predicted protein structure.

In summary, Backbone Distance Loss is a metric used to evaluate the accuracy of predicted protein structures. It is computed by comparing the predicted and true coordinates of the three backbone atoms, and it is a useful tool for assessing the performance of protein structure prediction algorithms.

------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the "Algorithm 10 backbone_distance_loss" in detail. This algorithm is commonly used in the field of computer vision and deep learning, specifically for tasks such as 3D object detection and pose estimation.

Let's start by breaking down the input parameters of this algorithm. The first input is $\hat{X}$, which is a 4D tensor of shape $L \times 3 \times 3$. This tensor represents the predicted 3D keypoints of an object in 3D space, where $L$ is the number of keypoints. The second input is $X$, which is also a 4D tensor of shape $L \times 3 \times 3$, but this time it represents the ground truth 3D keypoints of the object.

The next step in the algorithm is to flatten both $\hat{X}$ and $X$ into 2D tensors of shape $3L \times 3$. This is done using the "flatten" function, which reshapes the 4D tensors into 2D tensors by concatenating the rows of the original tensors.

Now that we have the flattened tensors, we can calculate the predicted and ground truth distances between each pair of keypoints. This is done using the Euclidean distance formula, which calculates the distance between two points in 3D space. The predicted distances are stored in a 2D tensor of shape $3L \times 3L$, while the ground truth distances are stored in a 2D tensor of shape $3L \times 3L$.

Next, we calculate the difference between the predicted and ground truth distances, which is stored in a 2D tensor of shape $3L \times 3L$. We then square this difference to get a 2D tensor of shape $3L \times 3L$ containing the squared errors.

To prevent the squared errors from becoming too large, we cap them at a maximum value of 25. This is done using the "min" function, which returns the smaller of two values.

Finally, we calculate the mean squared error across all keypoint pairs, which gives us a single value representing the overall distance between the predicted and ground truth keypoints. This value is returned as the output of the algorithm.

In summary, the "Algorithm 10 backbone_distance_loss" calculates the distance between predicted and ground truth 3D keypoints of an object in 3D space, and returns a single value representing the overall distance between the two sets of keypoints. This algorithm is commonly used in tasks such as 3D object detection and pose estimation in the field of computer vision and deep learning.

2. Backbone Direction Loss: Compute six vectors for both predicted and ground truth coordinates for each residue:
(a) $N \rightarrow C_{\alpha}$
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of Backbone Direction Loss in the field of protein structure prediction.

To understand this concept, we first need to define some terms that may not be obvious to those who are not experts in this field.

First, let's define what we mean by "backbone". The backbone of a protein refers to the chain of amino acids that make up the protein's structure. Each amino acid is connected to the next by a peptide bond, which forms a chain-like structure.

Next, we need to define what we mean by "direction". In this context, direction refers to the orientation of the backbone chain in three-dimensional space.

Now, let's move on to the concept of Backbone Direction Loss. This is a measure of how well a predicted protein structure matches the true structure of the protein. To calculate this loss, we need to compute six vectors for both the predicted and ground truth coordinates for each residue.

The first vector is from the nitrogen atom (N) to the alpha carbon atom (Cα) of the same residue. This vector represents the direction of the backbone chain for that particular residue.

We then repeat this process for each residue in the protein, resulting in a total of six vectors for both the predicted and ground truth coordinates.

By comparing these vectors, we can calculate the Backbone Direction Loss, which gives us a measure of how well the predicted structure matches the true structure of the protein.

In summary, Backbone Direction Loss is a measure of how well a predicted protein structure matches the true structure of the protein. It is calculated by computing six vectors for both the predicted and ground truth coordinates for each residue, representing the direction of the backbone chain for that particular residue.

(b) $C_{\alpha} \rightarrow C$
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the reference (b) $C_{\alpha} \rightarrow C$. This reference is commonly used in the field of protein structure analysis and refers to a specific type of chemical shift in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.

Let's break down the reference into its components. The "C" in $C_{\alpha}$ refers to the carbon atom in the protein backbone. The "alpha" in $C_{\alpha}$ refers to the alpha carbon, which is the carbon atom that is directly attached to the carbonyl carbon in the peptide bond.

The "C" in $C \rightarrow C_{\alpha}$ refers to the carbonyl carbon in the peptide bond. This carbonyl carbon is the carbon atom that is double-bonded to the oxygen atom in the peptide bond.

The arrow in the reference indicates a chemical shift in NMR spectroscopy. NMR spectroscopy is a technique used to study the structure and properties of molecules, including proteins. In NMR spectroscopy, a strong magnetic field is applied to the sample, which causes the nuclei of certain atoms to align with the magnetic field. When a radio frequency pulse is applied to the sample, the nuclei absorb energy and become excited. As the nuclei return to their original state, they emit energy in the form of a radio frequency signal. The frequency of this signal is dependent on the chemical environment of the nucleus, and can be used to determine the structure of the molecule.

In the case of the reference (b) $C_{\alpha} \rightarrow C$, the chemical shift indicates a specific interaction between the alpha carbon and the carbonyl carbon in the peptide bond. This interaction is known as a hydrogen bond, and is an important factor in determining the structure and stability of proteins.

In summary, the reference (b) $C_{\alpha} \rightarrow C$ refers to a specific type of chemical shift in NMR spectroscopy that indicates a hydrogen bond between the alpha carbon and the carbonyl carbon in the peptide bond of a protein. This interaction is important in determining the structure and stability of proteins, and is a key factor in the field of protein structure analysis.

(c) $C \rightarrow N_{\text {next }}$
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the reference (c) $C \rightarrow N_{\text {next }}$. This reference is commonly used in the field of computer science and programming, specifically in the context of algorithms and data structures.

Let's break down the reference into its individual components. The letter "c" represents a constant, which is a value that does not change during the execution of a program. In this case, the constant is likely a variable or a parameter that is being used in the algorithm or data structure being discussed.

The arrow symbol "$\rightarrow$" represents a transition or a change in state. In this context, it indicates that the constant "c" is being transformed or modified in some way.

The letter "N" represents a variable or a parameter that is being updated or modified as a result of the transition. The subscript "next" indicates that this variable or parameter is being updated to its next value or state.

So, in summary, the reference (c) $C \rightarrow N_{\text {next }}$ is describing a transition or change in state where a constant "c" is being modified and a variable or parameter "N" is being updated to its next value or state.

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference related to the field of molecular biology. Specifically, we will be looking at the equation (d) $\mathbf{n}_{C_{\alpha}}=-\left(N \rightarrow C_{\alpha}\right) \times\left(C_{\alpha} \rightarrow C\right)$.

Let's start by breaking down the equation into its individual components. The first term, $\mathbf{n}_{C_{\alpha}}$, refers to the normal vector of the carbon alpha atom. This is a vector that is perpendicular to the plane of the carbon alpha atom and is used to determine the orientation of the atom in space.

The second term, $N \rightarrow C_{\alpha}$, represents the vector pointing from the nitrogen atom to the carbon alpha atom. This vector is used to determine the position of the carbon alpha atom relative to the nitrogen atom.

The third term, $C_{\alpha} \rightarrow C$, represents the vector pointing from the carbon alpha atom to the carbon atom. This vector is used to determine the position of the carbon atom relative to the carbon alpha atom.

The final term, $\times$, represents the cross product of the two vectors. This operation produces a new vector that is perpendicular to both of the input vectors and is used to determine the orientation of the carbon alpha atom relative to the nitrogen and carbon atoms.

In summary, this equation is used to determine the orientation and position of the carbon alpha atom in a protein structure relative to the nitrogen and carbon atoms. It is an important tool in the field of molecular biology for understanding the structure and function of proteins.

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the equation $\mathbf{n}_{N}=\left(C_{\text {prev }} \rightarrow N\right) \times\left(N \rightarrow C_{\alpha}\right)$. This equation is commonly used in the field of molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the normal vector of a plane.

Let's break down the equation and explain each term in detail. The first term, $C_{\text {prev }} \rightarrow N$, represents the vector from the previous carbon atom to the current carbon atom, N. This vector is used to define the plane that we want to calculate the normal vector for.

The second term, $N \rightarrow C_{\alpha}$, represents the vector from the current carbon atom, N, to the alpha carbon atom. This vector is used to define the direction of the plane.

The cross product of these two vectors gives us the normal vector of the plane, which is represented by the symbol $\mathbf{n}_{N}$. This normal vector is perpendicular to the plane and points in the direction of the plane's surface.

In summary, this equation is used to calculate the normal vector of a plane in molecular dynamics simulations. The two vectors used in the equation define the plane and its direction, and the cross product of these vectors gives us the normal vector.

This reference is used in the field of molecular dynamics simulations, specifically in the context of protein folding.

Let's break down the terms in this reference. $\mathbf{n}_{C}$ represents the normal vector of the carbon atom in question. A normal vector is a vector that is perpendicular to a surface or plane. In this case, the normal vector is pointing away from the carbon atom.

$C_{\alpha}$ is the alpha carbon atom, which is the carbon atom that is directly attached to the carbonyl carbon atom in a peptide bond. The carbonyl carbon atom is the carbon atom that is double bonded to an oxygen atom.

$C$ represents the carbon atom in question.

$N_{\text {next }}$ is the nitrogen atom that is next in the sequence of amino acids in the protein.

The cross product $\times$ is a mathematical operation that takes two vectors and returns a third vector that is perpendicular to both of the input vectors.

So, in summary, this reference is describing the normal vector of a carbon atom in a protein, which is calculated by taking the cross product of the vector from the alpha carbon atom to the carbon atom in question, and the vector from the carbon atom in question to the next nitrogen atom in the sequence of amino acids.

Compute the pairwise dot product, forming $D_{\text {pred }}, D \in$ $\mathbb{R}^{6 L \times 6 L}$. Compute $\left(D_{\text {pred }}-D\right)^{2}$, clamp the maximum error to 20 , and take the mean.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing how to compute the pairwise dot product and the mean squared error for a given reference.

First, let's define some terms. The pairwise dot product is a mathematical operation that takes two vectors and multiplies them element-wise, then sums the products. This operation is commonly used in machine learning and data analysis to measure the similarity between two vectors.

In this context, we are computing the pairwise dot product between two matrices, $D_{\text {pred }}$ and $D$, both of which are in $\mathbb{R}^{6 L \times 6 L}$. This means that both matrices have $6 L$ rows and $6 L$ columns, where $L$ is some positive integer.

Once we have computed the pairwise dot product, we then calculate the squared difference between $D_{\text {pred }}$ and $D$. This gives us a matrix of squared errors, which we can then clamp to a maximum value of 20. Clamping means that any value greater than 20 will be set to 20.

Finally, we take the mean of the squared errors to get the mean squared error. This is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models.

So, to summarize, we are computing the pairwise dot product between two matrices, calculating the squared difference between them, clamping the maximum error to 20, and taking the mean to get the mean squared error.

In algorithm form (with compute_vectors computing the six vectors described above):
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference to experts in the field of algorithms. Specifically, we will be looking at an algorithm that computes six vectors.

Before we dive into the algorithm, let's first define some terms that may not be obvious to those who are not familiar with this field.

An algorithm is a set of instructions that are used to solve a problem or complete a task. In this case, the algorithm we will be discussing is used to compute six vectors.

A vector is a mathematical object that has both magnitude and direction. In this algorithm, we will be computing six vectors, each with its own magnitude and direction.

Now that we have defined these terms, let's take a look at the algorithm itself.

The algorithm is called compute_vectors and it takes in no parameters. It begins by initializing six vectors, each with a magnitude of 1 and a random direction.

Next, the algorithm enters a loop that will iterate a certain number of times. Within this loop, the algorithm will update the direction of each vector based on a set of rules.

After the loop has completed, the algorithm will return the six vectors that were computed.

In summary, the compute_vectors algorithm is used to compute six vectors, each with a magnitude of 1 and a random direction. The algorithm then updates the direction of each vector based on a set of rules and returns the final set of vectors.

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the reference to Algorithm 11 backbone_direction_loss. This algorithm is used in the field of computer vision and specifically in the task of 3D object detection.

Let's start by breaking down the input parameters of the algorithm. The first input is $\hat{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times 3 \times 3}$, which represents the predicted 3D bounding boxes of objects in the scene. The second input is $X \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times 3 \times 3}$, which represents the ground truth 3D bounding boxes of objects in the scene.

The next step is to compute the vectors for both the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes using the function compute_vectors. This function takes in the 3D bounding boxes and outputs a set of vectors that represent the orientation and size of the bounding box.

Once we have the vectors for both the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes, we can calculate the predicted direction loss. This is done by computing the dot product between the vectors of the predicted bounding boxes and multiplying it with the transpose of the vectors of the predicted bounding boxes. This results in a matrix $\left[D_{\text {pred }}\right]_{i, j}=[\hat{V}]_{i,:} \cdot[\hat{V}]_{j,:} \quad \triangleright \mathbb{R}^{6 L \times 6 L}$.

We then repeat this process for the ground truth bounding boxes, resulting in a matrix $[D]_{i, j}=[V]_{i,:} \cdot[V]_{j,:} \quad \triangleright \mathbb{R}^{6 L \times 6 L}$.

Next, we calculate the difference between the predicted and ground truth direction loss matrices, resulting in a matrix $E=\left(D_{\text {pred }}-D\right)^{2}$.

To prevent the loss from becoming too large, we cap the maximum value of $E$ at 20.

Finally, we calculate the mean of the loss matrix, resulting in a scalar value $l=\operatorname{mean}_{i, j}(E) \quad \triangleright \mathbb{R}$.

And that's it! This algorithm is used to calculate the direction loss between predicted and ground truth 3D bounding boxes in the task of 3D object detection.

Thank you for watching and we hope this explanation was helpful!

3. Binned Direction Classification Loss: This loss captures a coarser similarity between ground truth and predicted orientations to stabilize early training. It uses the last layer representations of the decoder, not the predicted coordinates. The process is as follows:
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on Binned Direction Classification Loss. This is a technique used in computer vision to stabilize early training of models that predict orientations.

Let's start by breaking down the term "Binned Direction Classification Loss". "Binned" refers to the process of grouping similar orientations into bins or categories. "Direction" refers to the orientation of an object in an image. "Classification" refers to the process of assigning a category or label to an object based on its orientation. "Loss" refers to the difference between the predicted orientation and the ground truth orientation.

So, what does this all mean in practice? Well, when training a model to predict orientations, it can be difficult to get accurate predictions in the early stages of training. This is because the model may not have enough data to learn from, or the data may be noisy or inconsistent.

To address this issue, Binned Direction Classification Loss is used to capture a coarser similarity between the ground truth and predicted orientations. This means that instead of trying to predict the exact orientation of an object, the model is trained to predict a category or bin that the orientation falls into.

The process of Binned Direction Classification Loss involves using the last layer representations of the decoder, which are the features extracted from the image by the model. These features are then used to predict the orientation of the object in the image.

The predicted orientation is then compared to the ground truth orientation, and a loss function is calculated based on the difference between the two. This loss function is designed to encourage the model to predict orientations that are similar to the ground truth, even if they are not exactly the same.

In summary, Binned Direction Classification Loss is a technique used in computer vision to stabilize early training of models that predict orientations. It involves grouping similar orientations into bins, and training the model to predict the category or bin that the orientation falls into. This helps to improve the accuracy of the model's predictions, even in the early stages of training.

(a) Unit vectors: Compute three vectors per residue from ground truth coordinates: $C_{\alpha} \rightarrow C, C_{\alpha} \rightarrow$ $N$, and $\mathbf{n}_{C_{\alpha}}=\left(C_{\alpha} \rightarrow C\right) \times\left(C_{\alpha} \rightarrow N\right)$, and normalize them to unit length.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of unit vectors in the context of protein structure analysis.

First, let's define what a vector is. A vector is a mathematical object that has both magnitude and direction. In the context of protein structure analysis, we use vectors to represent the position of atoms in a protein.

Now, let's talk about unit vectors. A unit vector is a vector that has a magnitude of 1. In other words, it is a vector that has been scaled down so that its length is equal to 1.

In protein structure analysis, we often use unit vectors to represent the orientation of atoms in a protein. Specifically, we can compute three unit vectors per residue from ground truth coordinates. These vectors are:

1. $C_{\alpha} \rightarrow C$: This vector represents the distance and direction from the C-alpha atom to the C-atom in the same residue.

2. $C_{\alpha} \rightarrow N$: This vector represents the distance and direction from the C-alpha atom to the N-atom in the same residue.

3. $\mathbf{n}_{C_{\alpha}}=\left(C_{\alpha} \rightarrow C\right) \times\left(C_{\alpha} \rightarrow N\right)$: This vector represents the normal vector to the plane formed by the C-alpha, C, and N atoms in the same residue.

To compute these vectors, we first need to obtain the ground truth coordinates of the atoms in the protein. These coordinates can be obtained from experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy.

Once we have the ground truth coordinates, we can use them to compute the three unit vectors per residue. We then normalize these vectors to unit length, which means we scale them down so that their length is equal to 1.

In summary, unit vectors are a useful tool in protein structure analysis for representing the orientation of atoms in a protein. By computing three unit vectors per residue from ground truth coordinates and normalizing them to unit length, we can obtain a more accurate representation of the protein structure.
==============================
(b) Dot Products: Compute pairwise dot products between each pair of vectors for all residues, forming $D \in[-1,1]^{L \times L \times 6}$. Bin the dot products into 16 evenly spaced bins in $[-1,1]$, forming classification labels $y \in\{0 . .15\}^{L \times L}$.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of dot products in the context of residue classification.

First, let's define what a dot product is. A dot product is a mathematical operation that takes two vectors of the same length and multiplies their corresponding components together, then adds up the products. The result is a single number that represents the degree of similarity between the two vectors.

In the context of residue classification, we are interested in computing the dot product between each pair of vectors for all residues. This means that we have a set of vectors representing each residue, and we want to compare them to each other to see how similar they are.

To do this, we first need to define what we mean by "residue". In this case, a residue refers to a specific amino acid in a protein structure. We can represent each residue as a vector of numerical values that describe its properties, such as its size, shape, and chemical properties.

Once we have our set of vectors representing each residue, we can compute the dot product between each pair of vectors. This will give us a measure of how similar each pair of residues is to each other.

However, we need to be careful when interpreting the dot product values. The dot product can range from -1 to 1, where -1 means the two vectors are completely dissimilar, 0 means they are orthogonal (perpendicular), and 1 means they are identical. However, in the context of residue classification, we want to bin the dot product values into a smaller set of categories that are more meaningful for our analysis.

To do this, we divide the range of dot product values into 16 evenly spaced bins, each representing a range of values from -1 to 1. We then assign each bin a label from 0 to 15, where 0 represents the most dissimilar residues and 15 represents the most similar residues.

The resulting classification labels, which we will call $y$, form a matrix of size $L \times L \times 6$, where $L$ is the number of residues in the protein structure and 6 represents the six possible pairwise combinations of residues.

In summary, we have used dot products to compare the similarity between each pair of residues in a protein structure, and we have binned the dot product values into 16 categories to form classification labels that we can use for further analysis.

I hope this explanation has been helpful in understanding the concept of dot products in the context of residue classification. Thank you for watching!###

(c) Pairwise Logits: Pass the final layer representations of the decoder $h \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times d}$ through a pairwise_proj_head to obtain logits $z \in$ $\mathbb{R}^{L \times L \times 6 \times 16}$.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on pairwise logits. In this video, we will be discussing the concept of pairwise logits and how they are used in the field of machine learning.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those who are not familiar with this field. The term "logits" refers to the output of a neural network before it is passed through a softmax function. This output is a vector of real numbers that represent the probability of each possible outcome.

Now, let's move on to the concept of pairwise logits. Pairwise logits are a type of logit that are used in tasks where there are multiple possible outcomes, such as in object detection or image segmentation. In these tasks, the goal is to predict the probability of each possible outcome for each pair of objects or pixels.

To obtain pairwise logits, we pass the final layer representations of the decoder through a pairwise projection head. This projection head is a neural network that takes in the final layer representations and outputs a tensor of logits. This tensor has dimensions $L \times L \times 6 \times 16$, where $L$ is the number of objects or pixels being considered, $6$ represents the six possible outcomes (in the case of object detection, these outcomes might be "person", "car", "tree", etc.), and $16$ represents the number of possible pairs of objects or pixels.

In summary, pairwise logits are a type of logit that are used in tasks where there are multiple possible outcomes. They are obtained by passing the final layer representations of the decoder through a pairwise projection head, which outputs a tensor of logits with dimensions $L \times L \times 6 \times 16$.

(d) Cross Entropy: Calculate cross-entropy loss using the labels $y$ from the ground truth structure and the logits $z$, and average over all $L \times L \times 6$ values.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of cross-entropy loss in the context of ground truth structures and logits.

First, let's define some terms. Ground truth structures refer to the true or correct labels of a dataset. These labels are used to train and evaluate machine learning models. Logits, on the other hand, are the output of a neural network before they are transformed into probabilities. They represent the raw scores of each class in a classification problem.

Now, let's talk about cross-entropy loss. Cross-entropy loss is a measure of the difference between the predicted probabilities and the true labels of a dataset. It is calculated by taking the negative log of the probability of the true label, which is then averaged over all the samples in the dataset.

In the context of ground truth structures and logits, we can calculate cross-entropy loss by first computing the logits $z$ from the input data. We then compare these logits to the ground truth labels $y$ to calculate the cross-entropy loss. This loss is then averaged over all $L \times L \times 6$ values, where $L$ is the length of the input data and $6$ represents the number of possible classes in the classification problem.

In summary, cross-entropy loss is a measure of the difference between predicted probabilities and true labels in a classification problem. When used in conjunction with ground truth structures and logits, it can help evaluate the performance of machine learning models and improve their accuracy.

Thank you for watching, and we hope this explanation has been helpful.
==============================
4. Distogram Loss: Similar to the Binned Direction Classification Loss, this loss bins the true distances between residues (specifically, their $C_{\beta}$ ) to get ground truth targets and computes a cross-entropy between these targets and pairwise logits. In detail: (a) Calculate $C_{\beta}$ : Given the ground truth $N, C_{\alpha}$, and $C$ coordinates, we compute the location of $C_{\beta}$ :
------------------------------
 $C_{\beta} = (C_{\alpha} + C) / 2$.

(b) Bin the distances: We then bin the distances between all pairs of $C_{\beta}$ atoms into $K$ bins, where $K$ is a hyperparameter.

(c) Compute the loss: We compute the cross-entropy loss between the ground truth bin assignments and the predicted bin assignments.

The Distogram Loss is used to encourage the model to learn a good representation of the protein structure by penalizing incorrect distance predictions. By binning the distances, we can capture the overall distribution of distances in the protein structure and encourage the model to learn a smooth and continuous representation of the structure.

i. Obtain the three vectors $N \rightarrow C_{\alpha}, C_{\alpha} \rightarrow C$, and $\mathbf{n}=\left(N \rightarrow C_{\alpha}\right) \times\left(C_{\alpha} \rightarrow C\right)$.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference used in the field of molecular dynamics simulations.

In this reference, the authors are interested in obtaining three vectors: $N \rightarrow C_{\alpha}$, $C_{\alpha} \rightarrow C$, and $\mathbf{n}=\left(N \rightarrow C_{\alpha}\right) \times\left(C_{\alpha} \rightarrow C\right)$.

Let's break down each of these vectors and explain what they represent.

The first vector, $N \rightarrow C_{\alpha}$, represents the distance between the nitrogen atom (N) and the carbon alpha atom (C_{\alpha}) in a protein. This distance is important because it can affect the stability and function of the protein.

The second vector, $C_{\alpha} \rightarrow C$, represents the distance between the carbon alpha atom (C_{\alpha}) and the carbon atom (C) in a protein. This distance is also important because it can affect the stability and function of the protein.

The third vector, $\mathbf{n}=\left(N \rightarrow C_{\alpha}\right) \times\left(C_{\alpha} \rightarrow C\right)$, is a bit more complex. It is the cross product of the first two vectors, which gives us a vector that is perpendicular to both of them. This vector is called the normal vector, and it is used to calculate the angle between the two planes formed by the first two vectors.

In summary, these three vectors are important in understanding the structure and function of proteins, and they are commonly used in molecular dynamics simulations. Thank you for watching, and we hope this explanation was helpful!

ii. Define the following scalars:
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the scalars mentioned in the reference material.

First, let's define what a scalar is. A scalar is a quantity that has magnitude but no direction. It is represented by a single number and can be positive, negative, or zero.

Now, let's define the specific scalars mentioned in the reference material:

1. Mass (m): Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object. It is measured in kilograms (kg) and is a fundamental property of matter.

2. Velocity (v): Velocity is a measure of how fast an object is moving in a particular direction. It is measured in meters per second (m/s) and is a vector quantity.

3. Acceleration (a): Acceleration is a measure of how quickly an object's velocity is changing. It is measured in meters per second squared (m/s²) and is a vector quantity.

4. Force (F): Force is a measure of the interaction between two objects that causes one object to accelerate. It is measured in newtons (N) and is a vector quantity.

5. Work (W): Work is a measure of the energy transferred when a force is applied to an object over a distance. It is measured in joules (J) and is a scalar quantity.

6. Power (P): Power is a measure of how quickly work is done. It is measured in watts (W) and is a scalar quantity.

7. Energy (E): Energy is a measure of the ability of an object to do work. It is measured in joules (J) and is a scalar quantity.

I hope this explanation has been helpful in understanding the scalars mentioned in the reference material. Thank you for watching!###

\begin{aligned}
a & =-0.58273431 \\
b & =0.56802827 \\
c & =-0.54067466
\end{aligned}
$$
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the meaning and significance of the values $a=-0.58273431$, $b=0.56802827$, and $c=-0.54067466$. These values are actually the coefficients of the cubic equation of state, also known as the Peng-Robinson equation of state.

The Peng-Robinson equation of state is a widely used equation of state in thermodynamics and chemical engineering. It is used to describe the behavior of fluids, particularly those found in the oil and gas industry. The equation is named after its developers, Ding-Yu Peng and Donald Robinson.

Now, let's break down the meaning of each coefficient. The coefficient $a$ is related to the attractive forces between molecules in a fluid. A negative value of $a$ indicates that the attractive forces between molecules are weak, which is typical of nonpolar fluids like hydrocarbons.

The coefficient $b$ is related to the repulsive forces between molecules in a fluid. A positive value of $b$ indicates that the repulsive forces between molecules are strong, which is also typical of nonpolar fluids like hydrocarbons.

Finally, the coefficient $c$ is related to the critical properties of the fluid, such as the critical temperature, pressure, and volume. A negative value of $c$ indicates that the critical properties of the fluid are similar to those of a nonpolar fluid like a hydrocarbon.

In summary, the values $a=-0.58273431$, $b=0.56802827$, and $c=-0.54067466$ are the coefficients of the Peng-Robinson equation of state, which is used to describe the behavior of fluids in the oil and gas industry. The coefficients are related to the attractive and repulsive forces between molecules, as well as the critical properties of the fluid.

iii. Compute the location of $C_{\beta}$ using the formula:
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on computing the location of $C_{\beta}$ using the formula. In this video, we will be discussing the concept of $C_{\beta}$ and how to use the formula to determine its location.

First, let's define what $C_{\beta}$ is. $C_{\beta}$ is a carbon atom in a protein that is located in the backbone of the protein chain. It is also known as the carbonyl carbon because it is part of a carbonyl group, which is a functional group that contains a carbon-oxygen double bond.

Now, let's move on to the formula for computing the location of $C_{\beta}$. The formula is as follows:

$C_{\beta}$ = $N_{\alpha}$ + $C_{\alpha}$ + $O$

Where $N_{\alpha}$ is the nitrogen atom in the backbone of the protein chain, $C_{\alpha}$ is the carbon atom in the backbone of the protein chain, and $O$ is the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group.

To use this formula, you need to identify the location of $N_{\alpha}$ and $C_{\alpha}$ in the protein chain. Once you have identified these locations, you can use the formula to determine the location of $C_{\beta}$.

It is important to note that the location of $C_{\beta}$ is important in understanding the structure and function of proteins. By knowing the location of $C_{\beta}$, researchers can better understand how proteins interact with other molecules and how they perform their biological functions.

In conclusion, computing the location of $C_{\beta}$ using the formula is an important tool in understanding the structure and function of proteins. By identifying the location of $N_{\alpha}$ and $C_{\alpha}$ in the protein chain, researchers can use the formula to determine the location of $C_{\beta}$ and gain insights into the biological functions of proteins. Thank you for watching!###

$C_{\beta}=a \mathbf{n}+b\left(N \rightarrow C_{\alpha}\right)+c\left(C_{\alpha} \rightarrow C\right)+C_{\alpha}$
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the reference $C_{\beta}=a \mathbf{n}+b\left(N \rightarrow C_{\alpha}\right)+c\left(C_{\alpha} \rightarrow C\right)+C_{\alpha}$. This reference is commonly used in the field of molecular dynamics simulations and is used to describe the motion of atoms in a molecule.

Let's start by breaking down the different terms in this equation. The first term, $a \mathbf{n}$, represents the motion of the atom in the direction of the normal mode of vibration. The normal mode of vibration is the most energetically favorable way for an atom to vibrate in a molecule. The term $\mathbf{n}$ represents the normal mode of vibration and $a$ is a constant that determines the amplitude of the motion.

The second term, $b\left(N \rightarrow C_{\alpha}\right)$, represents the motion of the atom towards the alpha carbon atom in the molecule. The alpha carbon atom is the carbon atom that is closest to a functional group, such as an amino or carboxyl group. The term $N$ represents the nitrogen atom in the molecule and $C_{\alpha}$ represents the alpha carbon atom. The constant $b$ determines the amplitude of the motion towards the alpha carbon atom.

The third term, $c\left(C_{\alpha} \rightarrow C\right)$, represents the motion of the atom towards the carbon atom in the molecule. The constant $c$ determines the amplitude of the motion towards the carbon atom.

Finally, the last term, $C_{\alpha}$, represents the motion of the alpha carbon atom in the molecule. This term is included because the motion of the alpha carbon atom is often used as a reference point for the motion of other atoms in the molecule.

In summary, the reference $C_{\beta}=a \mathbf{n}+b\left(N \rightarrow C_{\alpha}\right)+c\left(C_{\alpha} \rightarrow C\right)+C_{\alpha}$ is used to describe the motion of atoms in a molecule during molecular dynamics simulations. The different terms in this equation represent the motion of the atom in the direction of the normal mode of vibration, towards the alpha carbon atom, towards the carbon atom, and the motion of the alpha carbon atom itself.
==============================
(b) Pairwise $C_{\beta}$ distances: Compute an $L \times L$ pairwise distance matrix of the $C_{\beta}$, and bin them into one of 64 bins, with lower bounds $\left[0,2.3125^{2},(2.3125+0.3075)^{2}, \ldots, 21.6875^{2}\right]$, forming the labels $y \in\{0 . .63\}^{L \times L}$.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on pairwise $C_{\beta}$ distances. In this video, we will be discussing how to compute an $L \times L$ pairwise distance matrix of the $C_{\beta}$ and how to bin them into one of 64 bins.

First, let's define what $C_{\beta}$ is. $C_{\beta}$ is a measure of the similarity between two protein structures. It is calculated by comparing the positions of the $C_{\alpha}$ atoms in the two structures. The $C_{\alpha}$ atoms are the backbone atoms of the protein, and they are used as a proxy for the position of the entire protein.

Now, let's talk about pairwise distances. Pairwise distances are the distances between each pair of structures in a dataset. In this case, we are interested in the $C_{\beta}$ distances between each pair of structures.

To compute the pairwise $C_{\beta}$ distances, we first need to align the structures. This is done by superimposing the $C_{\alpha}$ atoms of each structure onto a reference structure. Once the structures are aligned, we can calculate the $C_{\beta}$ distances between each pair of structures.

The resulting $L \times L$ pairwise distance matrix contains the $C_{\beta}$ distances between each pair of structures in the dataset. However, this matrix can be difficult to interpret, as it contains a large amount of data.

To make the data more manageable, we can bin the $C_{\beta}$ distances into one of 64 bins. The lower bounds of these bins are $\left[0,2.3125^{2},(2.3125+0.3075)^{2}, \ldots, 21.6875^{2}\right]$. These bins are labeled $y \in\{0 . .63\}^{L \times L}$.

By binning the $C_{\beta}$ distances, we can visualize the data more easily and identify patterns in the data. This can be useful for understanding the relationships between different protein structures and for identifying potential targets for drug development.

In summary, pairwise $C_{\beta}$ distances are a measure of the similarity between two protein structures. To compute these distances, we first align the structures and then calculate the $C_{\beta}$ distances between each pair of structures. The resulting $L \times L$ pairwise distance matrix can be binned into one of 64 bins to make the data more manageable and to identify patterns in the data.

(c) Pairwise logits: Pass the final layer representations of the decoder $h \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times d}$ through a pairwise_proj_head to obtain the logits $z \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times L \times 64}$.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on pairwise logits. In this video, we will be discussing the concept of pairwise logits and how they are used in the field of natural language processing.

To begin, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those who are not familiar with this field. The first term we need to define is "decoder". In natural language processing, a decoder is a neural network that takes in a sequence of input vectors and produces a sequence of output vectors. The decoder is typically used in tasks such as machine translation, where the input sequence is in one language and the output sequence is in another language.

The next term we need to define is "final layer representations". The final layer representations refer to the output of the decoder. These representations are typically in the form of a matrix, where each row represents a word in the output sequence.

Now, let's move on to the concept of pairwise logits. Pairwise logits are a type of logit that are used in tasks such as machine translation. To obtain pairwise logits, we first pass the final layer representations of the decoder through a pairwise projection head. This projection head is a neural network that takes in the final layer representations and produces a matrix of logits.

The logits are then used to calculate the probability of each possible translation for each word in the output sequence. This is done by taking the dot product of the logits and a matrix of weights. The resulting matrix of probabilities is then used to select the most likely translation for each word in the output sequence.

In summary, pairwise logits are a type of logit that are used in tasks such as machine translation. They are obtained by passing the final layer representations of the decoder through a pairwise projection head, which produces a matrix of logits. These logits are then used to calculate the probability of each possible translation for each word in the output sequence.

(d) Cross Entropy: Calculate the cross-entropy using the labels $y$ computed from the ground truth structure and the logits $z$, then average over all $L \times L$ values.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on cross entropy. In this video, we will be discussing what cross entropy is and how it is calculated.

Cross entropy is a measure of the difference between two probability distributions. It is commonly used in machine learning and deep learning to evaluate the performance of a model.

To calculate cross entropy, we first need to understand the concept of logits. Logits are the output of a neural network before the final activation function is applied. They are a measure of the probability of a certain class being present in the input data.

Once we have the logits, we can calculate the cross entropy using the following formula:

$$
H(p, q) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \log(q_i)
$$

Where $p$ is the true probability distribution, $q$ is the predicted probability distribution, and $n$ is the number of classes.

In the context of machine learning, we typically use the labels $y$ computed from the ground truth structure as the true probability distribution, and the logits $z$ as the predicted probability distribution.

To calculate the cross entropy, we first compute the logits $z$ using the neural network. We then use the labels $y$ to compute the true probability distribution. Finally, we use the formula above to calculate the cross entropy.

To average over all $L \times L$ values, we simply sum up the cross entropy values for each class and divide by the total number of classes.

In summary, cross entropy is a measure of the difference between two probability distributions. It is commonly used in machine learning and deep learning to evaluate the performance of a model. To calculate cross entropy, we first need to understand the concept of logits, and then use the true probability distribution and predicted probability distribution to compute the cross entropy using the formula above.

5. Inverse Folding Loss: Pass final layer representations of the decoder through a regression head to produce logits $z$. Using ground truth residues as labels $y$, compute cross-entropy for the classification task of predicting residues from final layer representations.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of Inverse Folding Loss. This is a term that is commonly used in the field of protein structure prediction, and it is an important metric for evaluating the performance of machine learning models that are designed to predict protein structures.

To understand what Inverse Folding Loss is, we first need to understand what protein structure prediction is. Protein structure prediction is the process of predicting the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. This is an important task because the structure of a protein determines its function, and understanding the structure of a protein can help us to design drugs and other therapeutics that target specific proteins.

Now, let's talk about Inverse Folding Loss. This is a metric that is used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models that are designed to predict protein structures. The idea behind Inverse Folding Loss is to measure how well the model is able to predict the correct amino acid residues in a protein structure.

To do this, the final layer representations of the decoder are passed through a regression head to produce logits $z$. These logits are then used to predict the correct amino acid residues in the protein structure. The ground truth residues are used as labels $y$, and the cross-entropy is computed for the classification task of predicting residues from final layer representations.

In other words, Inverse Folding Loss measures how well the model is able to predict the correct amino acid residues in a protein structure, and it is an important metric for evaluating the performance of machine learning models that are designed for protein structure prediction.

------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the reference A.1.7.3.2. Stage 2. This reference is related to the field of project management and specifically refers to the second stage of a project.

Let's break down the reference further. The "A" stands for "Appendix" and indicates that this reference is located in the appendix section of a document. The "1" refers to the first appendix, while the "7" refers to the seventh section within that appendix. The "3" refers to the third subsection within that section, and the "2" refers to the second sub-subsection within that subsection.

Now, let's discuss what the second stage of a project typically entails. This stage is often referred to as the "planning stage" and involves creating a detailed plan for the project. This plan includes identifying project goals, defining project scope, creating a project schedule, and determining project resources.

During this stage, it is important to involve all stakeholders in the planning process to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that the project goals are aligned with the organization's overall objectives.

In conclusion, A.1.7.3.2. Stage 2 refers to the second stage of a project, which is the planning stage. This stage involves creating a detailed plan for the project and is an important step in ensuring project success. Thank you for watching!###

In the second stage of VQ-VAE training, the encoder and codebook are frozen and a new, deeper, decoder is trained. This second stage of training has multiple purposes. First, a larger decoder improves reconstruction quality. Second, augmented structure tokens from ESM3 are added to enable learning pAE and pLDDT heads. Third, we add sequence conditioning and train with all-atom geometric losses to be able to decode all-atom protein structures. Fourth, we extend the context length of the decoder to be able to decode multimers and larger single chain proteins.

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the second stage of VQ-VAE training. VQ-VAE stands for Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder, which is a type of deep learning model used for protein structure prediction.

In the second stage of VQ-VAE training, the encoder and codebook are frozen, which means they are not updated during training. Instead, a new, deeper decoder is trained. This decoder is responsible for generating the protein structure from the encoded representation.

There are several purposes for this second stage of training. First, a larger decoder improves the quality of the reconstructed protein structure. This is because a larger decoder can capture more complex features of the protein structure.

Second, augmented structure tokens from ESM3 are added to enable learning pAE and pLDDT heads. ESM3 stands for Evolutionary Scale Modeling, which is a type of protein structure prediction model. pAE and pLDDT are two types of protein structure quality assessment metrics. By adding these tokens, the model can learn to predict these metrics more accurately.

Third, we add sequence conditioning and train with all-atom geometric losses to be able to decode all-atom protein structures. Sequence conditioning means that the model takes into account the sequence of amino acids in the protein when generating the structure. All-atom geometric losses refer to the loss function used during training, which measures the difference between the predicted and true all-atom protein structure.

Finally, we extend the context length of the decoder to be able to decode multimers and larger single chain proteins. Context length refers to the number of amino acids that the decoder takes into account when generating the protein structure. By extending the context length, the model can generate structures for larger proteins.

In summary, the second stage of VQ-VAE training involves training a larger decoder with augmented structure tokens, sequence conditioning, all-atom geometric losses, and extended context length. This allows the model to generate more accurate and complex protein structures.

Training data for stage 2 consists of predicted structures in AFDB and ESMAtlas, as well as single chain, multimer, and antibody-antigen complexes from the PDB. Sequence conditioning was added to the decoder via learned embeddings which are summed with structure token embeddings at the input to the decoder stack.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the use of training data for stage 2 in the field of protein structure prediction.

First, let's define some key terms. Protein structure prediction is the process of determining the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. AFDB stands for Antibody Fragment Data Base, which is a database of antibody fragments and their structures. ESMAtlas is a database of protein structures predicted by the ESM-1 model. PDB stands for Protein Data Bank, which is a database of protein structures determined experimentally.

Now, let's dive into the details of the training data used for stage 2. This stage involves using predicted structures from AFDB and ESMAtlas, as well as single chain, multimer, and antibody-antigen complexes from the PDB. These structures are used to train the model to predict protein structures accurately.

In addition to using these structures, sequence conditioning was added to the decoder via learned embeddings. This means that the model was trained to take into account the sequence of amino acids in the protein when predicting its structure. This was achieved by adding learned embeddings to the decoder, which are essentially numerical representations of the amino acid sequence. These embeddings are then summed with structure token embeddings at the input to the decoder stack.

Overall, the use of training data for stage 2 is crucial in the field of protein structure prediction. By using predicted structures and sequence conditioning, the model can accurately predict the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence.

The structure token decoder was trained in three stages: $2 \mathrm{~A}$, 2B, 2C detailed in Table S2. The purpose of stage 2A is to efficiently learn decoding of all-atom structures. Enhanced training efficiency is achieved by keeping a short context length and omitting the pAE and pLDDT losses, which are both memory-consuming and can be in competition with strong reconstruction quality. In stage $2 \mathrm{~B}$, we add the pAE and pLDDT losses. These structure confidence heads cannot be well-calibrated unless structure tokens are augmented such that ESM3-predicted structure tokens are within the training distribution. To this end, for stages $2 \mathrm{~B}$ and $2 \mathrm{C}$ we replace ground truth structure tokens with ESM3-predicted structure tokens $50 \%$ of the time. In stage $2 \mathrm{C}$, we extend context length to 2048 and upsample experimental structures relative to predicted structures.

In summary, the structure token decoder is a tool used in protein structure prediction and was trained in three stages to efficiently learn decoding of all-atom structures. The training process involved adding structure confidence heads, augmenting structure tokens, and upsampling experimental structures to ensure a diverse training set.

1. All-atom Distance Loss: We generalize the Backbone Distance Loss to all atoms by computing a pairwise $L_{2}$ distance matrix for all 14 atoms in the atom14 representation of each residue. This results in $D_{\text {pred }}, D \in \mathbb{R}^{14 L \times 14 L}$. The rest of the computation follows as before: $\left(D_{\text {pred }}-D\right)^{2}$, clamping to $(5 \AA)^{2}$, and taking the mean, while masking invalid pairs (where any atom14 representations are "empty").
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of All-atom Distance Loss. This is a term that is commonly used in the field of protein structure prediction and refers to a specific type of loss function that is used in deep learning models.

To understand what All-atom Distance Loss is, we first need to understand what a loss function is. In machine learning, a loss function is a mathematical function that measures the difference between the predicted output of a model and the actual output. The goal of a loss function is to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual outputs, which helps the model to learn and improve its accuracy.

In the context of protein structure prediction, the All-atom Distance Loss is a specific type of loss function that is used to measure the distance between predicted and actual protein structures. The term "all-atom" refers to the fact that the loss function takes into account the distance between all atoms in the protein structure, rather than just the distance between the backbone atoms.

To compute the All-atom Distance Loss, we first need to represent the protein structure in a way that can be used by a deep learning model. One common representation is the atom14 representation, which represents each amino acid in the protein as a set of 14 atoms.

Once we have the atom14 representation of the protein structure, we can compute a pairwise $L_{2}$ distance matrix for all 14 atoms in each residue. This results in a matrix $D_{\text {pred }}$ that represents the predicted distances between all atoms in the protein structure.

We can then compare the predicted distances to the actual distances between atoms in the protein structure, which are represented by the matrix $D$. To do this, we compute the squared difference between the predicted and actual distances, clamp the result to a maximum value of $(5 \AA)^{2}$, and take the mean of the result.

Finally, we mask any invalid pairs of atoms where any atom14 representations are "empty", meaning that they do not have a corresponding atom in the protein structure.

In summary, the All-atom Distance Loss is a loss function that is used in deep learning models for protein structure prediction. It measures the distance between predicted and actual protein structures by computing a pairwise $L_{2}$ distance matrix for all 14 atoms in each residue, and then computing the squared difference between the predicted and actual distances. By minimizing this loss function, the model can learn to accurately predict protein structures.

2. All-atom Direction Loss: We extend the Backbone Direction Loss to all heavy atoms:
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of All-atom Direction Loss. This is a term that is commonly used in the field of protein structure prediction and refers to a specific type of loss function that is used in deep learning models.

To understand what All-atom Direction Loss is, we first need to understand what a loss function is. A loss function is a mathematical function that is used to measure the difference between the predicted output of a model and the actual output. In the context of protein structure prediction, the predicted output is the predicted 3D structure of a protein, while the actual output is the true 3D structure of the protein.

The Backbone Direction Loss is a type of loss function that is commonly used in protein structure prediction. It measures the difference between the predicted backbone angles of a protein and the true backbone angles. However, the Backbone Direction Loss only considers the backbone atoms of a protein, which are the nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen atoms that make up the backbone of the protein.

The All-atom Direction Loss is an extension of the Backbone Direction Loss that considers all heavy atoms in a protein, not just the backbone atoms. Heavy atoms are atoms that have a mass greater than hydrogen, such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. By considering all heavy atoms, the All-atom Direction Loss is able to capture more information about the 3D structure of a protein and can lead to more accurate predictions.

In summary, the All-atom Direction Loss is a type of loss function that is used in protein structure prediction to measure the difference between the predicted 3D structure of a protein and the true 3D structure. It is an extension of the Backbone Direction Loss that considers all heavy atoms in a protein, not just the backbone atoms. By using the All-atom Direction Loss, we can improve the accuracy of our protein structure predictions and gain a better understanding of the 3D structures of proteins.

(a) Compute a pairwise distance matrix per residue from the 3D coordinates of each atom in atom14 representation, resulting in $\mathbb{R}^{L \times 14 \times 14}$.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the process of computing a pairwise distance matrix per residue from the 3D coordinates of each atom in atom14 representation.

Let's start by breaking down the terms used in this process.

First, we have the 3D coordinates of each atom in atom14 representation. This refers to the three-dimensional coordinates of each atom in a protein structure, where each atom is represented by 14 parameters. These parameters include the x, y, and z coordinates of the atom, as well as its occupancy, temperature factor, and other relevant information.

Next, we have the pairwise distance matrix. This is a matrix that contains the distances between all pairs of atoms in the protein structure. The matrix is symmetric, meaning that the distance between atom A and atom B is the same as the distance between atom B and atom A.

Finally, we have the per residue computation. This means that we are computing the pairwise distance matrix for each residue in the protein structure. A residue is a building block of a protein, consisting of a specific sequence of amino acids.

So, when we put it all together, computing a pairwise distance matrix per residue from the 3D coordinates of each atom in atom14 representation means that we are calculating the distances between all pairs of atoms in each residue of a protein structure, using the 3D coordinates of each atom in atom14 representation.

The resulting matrix is a $\mathbb{R}^{L \times 14 \times 14}$ matrix, where L is the number of residues in the protein structure. This matrix contains all the pairwise distances between atoms in the protein structure, organized by residue.

I hope this explanation has been helpful in understanding the process of computing a pairwise distance matrix per residue from the 3D coordinates of each atom in atom14 representation. Thank you for watching!###

(b) Mark atoms less than $2 \AA$ apart (excluding self) as covalent bonds.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on understanding the reference "(b) Mark atoms less than $2 \AA$ apart (excluding self) as covalent bonds." This reference is commonly used in the field of chemistry and is related to the concept of chemical bonding.

Let's start by breaking down the reference into its individual parts. The "b" in the reference simply refers to a specific point or instruction within a larger set of instructions or guidelines.

The next part of the reference, "Mark atoms less than $2 \AA$ apart," refers to the distance between two atoms in a molecule. An $\AA$, or angstrom, is a unit of measurement commonly used in chemistry to describe the distance between atoms or molecules. One $\AA$ is equal to $10^{-10}$ meters.

So, when the reference says to mark atoms that are less than $2 \AA$ apart, it means to identify any pairs of atoms in a molecule that are closer together than $2 \AA$. This is important because when atoms are this close together, they are likely to be bonded to each other through a covalent bond.

A covalent bond is a type of chemical bond that occurs when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons. This sharing of electrons allows the atoms to stick together and form a molecule. Covalent bonds are one of the two main types of chemical bonds, the other being ionic bonds.

The final part of the reference, "(excluding self)," simply means that you should not mark any atoms that are bonded to themselves. This is because self-bonding is not a common occurrence in chemical bonding and is not relevant to the task at hand.

In summary, the reference "(b) Mark atoms less than $2 \AA$ apart (excluding self) as covalent bonds" is a guideline for identifying covalent bonds in a molecule. It instructs you to identify any pairs of atoms that are closer together than $2 \AA$, which are likely to be bonded through a covalent bond. This is an important concept in the field of chemistry and is used to understand the structure and behavior of molecules.

(c) Filter to keep atoms with at least 2 covalent bonds, keeping only the first 2 bonds per atom, with ordering determined by the atom 14 representation.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference that may be useful for experts in the field of chemistry. The reference is as follows: (c) Filter to keep atoms with at least 2 covalent bonds, keeping only the first 2 bonds per atom, with ordering determined by the atom 14 representation.

Let's break down this reference into its individual components to better understand what it means.

First, we have the term "atoms with at least 2 covalent bonds." This refers to atoms that are connected to at least two other atoms through a covalent bond. A covalent bond is a type of chemical bond where two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons.

Next, we have the phrase "keeping only the first 2 bonds per atom." This means that we are only interested in the first two covalent bonds that an atom forms with other atoms. If an atom forms more than two covalent bonds, we will only consider the first two.

Finally, we have the phrase "with ordering determined by the atom 14 representation." This refers to the way in which the atoms are ordered in the molecule. The atom 14 representation is a way of numbering the atoms in a molecule based on their position in the periodic table. The ordering of the atoms is determined by their atomic number, with the lowest atomic number being assigned to the first atom in the molecule.

In summary, this reference is a filter that selects atoms with at least two covalent bonds, keeps only the first two bonds per atom, and orders the atoms based on their atomic number. This information may be useful for experts in the field of chemistry who are working with molecules and need to analyze their structure and properties.

(d) For each selected atom, compute a normal (zaxis) vector to the plane spanned by its two covalent bonds, resulting in three vectors per selected atom.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the process of computing normal vectors for selected atoms in a molecule.

In order to understand this process, we first need to define some key terms. A normal vector is a vector that is perpendicular to a plane or surface. In this case, we are interested in computing normal vectors to the plane spanned by an atom's two covalent bonds.

A covalent bond is a type of chemical bond that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. These bonds are typically represented by a line connecting the two atoms involved in the bond.

Now, let's break down the process of computing normal vectors for selected atoms. For each selected atom, we will first identify the two atoms it is bonded to. We will then compute a vector that is perpendicular to the plane spanned by these two bonds. This vector will be the normal vector for the selected atom.

To compute the normal vector, we will use the cross product of the two bond vectors. The cross product of two vectors gives us a new vector that is perpendicular to both of the original vectors. This new vector will be the normal vector we are looking for.

Once we have computed the normal vector for each selected atom, we will have a total of three vectors per selected atom. These vectors will be used in further analysis of the molecule's structure and properties.

In summary, computing normal vectors for selected atoms involves identifying the two atoms an atom is bonded to, computing a vector perpendicular to the plane spanned by these two bonds, and using the cross product of the bond vectors to obtain the normal vector. This process is important in understanding the structure and properties of molecules.

(e) Randomly subsample to 10,000 vectors per protein if the number exceeds 10,000 , ensuring the same vectors are sampled in both predicted and ground truth structures.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference that may be helpful for experts in the field of protein structure prediction.

The reference we will be discussing is "(e) Randomly subsample to 10,000 vectors per protein if the number exceeds 10,000, ensuring the same vectors are sampled in both predicted and ground truth structures."

Let's break this down into smaller parts to better understand what it means.

First, we have the term "subsample." This refers to the process of selecting a smaller subset of data from a larger dataset. In this case, we are selecting 10,000 vectors per protein.

Next, we have the term "vectors." In the context of protein structure prediction, vectors refer to the coordinates of atoms in a protein structure. These coordinates are typically represented as a set of three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates.

The term "predicted" refers to the protein structure that has been predicted by a computational algorithm. The term "ground truth" refers to the actual structure of the protein that has been experimentally determined.

Finally, the phrase "ensuring the same vectors are sampled in both predicted and ground truth structures" means that the same set of vectors will be used for both the predicted and ground truth structures. This is important because it allows for a more accurate comparison between the predicted and ground truth structures.

In summary, this reference is suggesting that when comparing predicted and ground truth protein structures, it is important to randomly subsample to 10,000 vectors per protein if the number exceeds 10,000, and to ensure that the same vectors are sampled in both predicted and ground truth structures.

Thank you for watching, and we hope this explanation has been helpful.

(f) Compute all-to-all pairwise dot products, forming $D_{\text {pred }}, D \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$. Compute $\left(D_{\text {pred }}-D\right)^{2}$, clamp the max to 20 , and take the mean.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a script that can be used to explain a reference to experts in a specific field. The reference we will be discussing is: (f) Compute all-to-all pairwise dot products, forming $D_{\text {pred }}, D \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$. Compute $\left(D_{\text {pred }}-D\right)^{2}$, clamp the max to 20 , and take the mean.

Let's start by breaking down the terms used in this reference. The first term, "all-to-all pairwise dot products", refers to a mathematical operation where we take the dot product of every pair of vectors in a set. In this case, we are taking the dot product of all pairs of vectors in the set $D_{\text {pred }}$ and $D$.

The next term, "forming $D_{\text {pred }}, D \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$", refers to the resulting matrices that are formed from the dot products. $D_{\text {pred }}$ is a predicted matrix, while $D$ is the true matrix. Both matrices are $n \times n$ matrices, where $n$ is the number of vectors in the set.

The next step is to compute $\left(D_{\text {pred }}-D\right)^{2}$. This is a common way to measure the difference between two matrices. We first subtract the predicted matrix from the true matrix, and then square the result. This gives us a matrix of squared differences.

The next step is to clamp the max to 20. This means that we will limit the maximum value in the matrix of squared differences to 20. This is done to prevent outliers from having too much influence on the final result.

Finally, we take the mean of the matrix of squared differences. This gives us a single value that represents the overall difference between the predicted and true matrices.

In summary, this reference describes a process for measuring the difference between two matrices using all-to-all pairwise dot products, forming $D_{\text {pred }}, D \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$. We then compute $\left(D_{\text {pred }}-D\right)^{2}$, clamp the max to 20 , and take the mean. This is a common technique used in machine learning and data analysis to evaluate the performance of predictive models.

3. pLDDT Head: Uses a Regression Head with 50 output classes (each capturing 0.02 units from 0 to 100 ). Predicted structures are compared to ground truth to calculate per-residue pLDDT values, which are supervised with cross-entropy loss.
4. pAE Head: Use a Pairwise Projection Head to produce 64 logits per residue pair $\in \mathbb{R}^{L \times L \times d}$, converting to probabilities $p$ via softmax. Each probability corresponds to a bin representing $0.5 \AA$ of positional error, with centers $[0.25,0.75, \ldots, 31.25,31.75]$.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the terms used in the script for explaining the reference to experts.

Let's start with the first term, pLDDT Head. This term refers to a regression head that uses 50 output classes, each capturing 0.02 units from 0 to 100. This means that the head is designed to predict the likelihood of a particular structure being correct, with a score ranging from 0 to 100. The predicted structures are then compared to the ground truth to calculate per-residue pLDDT values, which are supervised with cross-entropy loss.

Moving on to the second term, pAE Head. This term refers to a pairwise projection head that produces 64 logits per residue pair. These logits are then converted to probabilities via softmax, with each probability corresponding to a bin representing 0.5 Angstroms of positional error. The centers of these bins range from 0.25 to 31.75 Angstroms.

In summary, the pLDDT Head is used to predict the likelihood of a particular structure being correct, while the pAE Head is used to predict the positional error of a particular structure. Both of these terms are important in the field of protein structure prediction and are used to evaluate the accuracy of predicted structures.

\section*{Computing Loss:}
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on computing loss. In this video, we will be discussing the concept of computing loss and its significance in the field of machine learning.

To begin with, let's define what we mean by loss. In machine learning, loss is a measure of how well a model is performing on a given task. It is a function that takes in the predicted output of a model and the actual output, and returns a value that represents the difference between the two. The goal of machine learning is to minimize this loss function, as a smaller loss indicates a better model.

Now, let's move on to computing loss. Computing loss involves calculating the value of the loss function for a given set of inputs and outputs. This is typically done during the training phase of a machine learning model, where the model is being optimized to minimize the loss function.

There are several types of loss functions that can be used in machine learning, such as mean squared error, cross-entropy, and hinge loss. Each of these functions has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which one to use depends on the specific problem being solved.

In order to compute the loss, we need to have a set of labeled data, where each input has a corresponding output. This labeled data is used to train the machine learning model, and the loss function is used to measure how well the model is performing on this data.

Once the loss function has been computed, it can be used to update the parameters of the model in order to minimize the loss. This is typically done using an optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent, which iteratively updates the parameters of the model in the direction that reduces the loss.

In conclusion, computing loss is an important concept in machine learning that involves calculating the value of the loss function for a given set of inputs and outputs. By minimizing the loss function, we can optimize the performance of a machine learning model and improve its accuracy on a given task. Thank you for watching, and we hope you found this video helpful.

(a) Compute the pairwise distances between residues in both the predicted and ground truth structures, resulting in distance matrices $D_{\text {pred }}$ and $D \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times L}$.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of computing pairwise distances between residues in both predicted and ground truth structures.

Let's start by breaking down the terms used in this statement. First, we have "residues", which are the building blocks of proteins. These are the individual amino acids that make up the protein chain.

Next, we have "predicted" and "ground truth" structures. Predicted structures are the structures of proteins that are predicted by computational methods, while ground truth structures are the actual structures of proteins that have been experimentally determined.

Now, let's move on to the concept of pairwise distances. Pairwise distances refer to the distances between pairs of residues in a protein structure. These distances are typically measured in units of angstroms (Å).

To compute these pairwise distances, we use distance matrices. A distance matrix is a square matrix that contains the pairwise distances between all pairs of residues in a protein structure. In this case, we have two distance matrices: $D_{\text {pred }}$ and $D$.

$D_{\text {pred }}$ is the distance matrix for the predicted structure, while $D$ is the distance matrix for the ground truth structure. Both matrices are in the form of $\mathbb{R}^{L \times L}$, which means they are real-valued matrices with dimensions of $L \times L$.

In summary, computing pairwise distances between residues in both predicted and ground truth structures involves using distance matrices to measure the distances between pairs of residues in a protein structure. These matrices are used to compare the predicted structure to the ground truth structure and evaluate the accuracy of the prediction.

(b) Calculate the differences $\left(D_{\text {pred }}-D\right)$.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing how to calculate the differences between predicted and actual values in a specific field.

In this context, the term "predicted" refers to the values that have been estimated or forecasted based on a certain model or algorithm. On the other hand, "actual" values refer to the real or observed values that have been measured or recorded.

To calculate the differences between these two sets of values, we use the formula $\left(D_{\text {pred }}-D\right)$. Here, $D_{\text {pred }}$ represents the predicted values, while $D$ represents the actual values.

To break it down further, the minus sign (-) indicates that we are subtracting the actual values from the predicted values. This gives us the difference between the two sets of values.

It's important to note that this calculation is commonly used in fields such as finance, economics, and statistics, where predictions and forecasts are often made based on historical data. By calculating the differences between predicted and actual values, we can evaluate the accuracy of our models and make adjustments as needed.

I hope this explanation has been helpful in understanding how to calculate the differences between predicted and actual values. If you have any further questions or would like more information, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for watching!###
==============================
(c) Bin these differences into 64 bins, generating classification targets for the logits.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the process of binning differences into 64 bins to generate classification targets for logits.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those who are not familiar with this field.

Logits are a mathematical function used in machine learning to predict the probability of a binary outcome. In this case, we are using logits to predict the probability of a certain classification target.

Binning is the process of grouping data into discrete categories or bins. In this case, we are binning differences into 64 bins.

Now, let's dive into the process of binning differences into 64 bins to generate classification targets for logits.

When we bin differences into 64 bins, we are essentially grouping similar differences together into discrete categories. This allows us to generate classification targets for our logits.

For example, let's say we have a dataset of images and we want to classify them as either "cat" or "dog". We can use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the images and generate logits.

To generate classification targets for our logits, we can bin the differences between the logits into 64 bins. This will group similar differences together and allow us to assign a probability to each bin.

Once we have assigned probabilities to each bin, we can use these probabilities to generate classification targets for our logits. For example, if the probability of a certain bin is high, we can assign that bin as the classification target for our logits.

In summary, binning differences into 64 bins is a process used to generate classification targets for logits in machine learning. By grouping similar differences together, we can assign probabilities to each bin and use these probabilities to generate classification targets for our logits.

Thank you for watching and we hope this video has been helpful in explaining the process of binning differences into 64 bins to generate classification targets for logits.
==============================
(d) Compute the loss using cross-entropy between these targets and the logits.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of computing the loss using cross-entropy between targets and logits.

First, let's define what we mean by targets and logits. Targets are the true labels or classes that we want our model to predict. For example, if we are trying to classify images of dogs and cats, the targets would be the labels "dog" or "cat" for each image.

Logits, on the other hand, are the output of our model before we apply any activation function. They represent the raw scores or probabilities of each class.

Now, let's talk about cross-entropy. Cross-entropy is a measure of the difference between two probability distributions. In the context of machine learning, we use cross-entropy to measure the difference between the true distribution of the targets and the predicted distribution of the logits.

To compute the loss using cross-entropy, we first need to calculate the cross-entropy between the targets and the logits. This is done using the following formula:

-1 * sum(targets * log(logits))

Here, we are taking the negative of the sum of the product of the targets and the log of the logits. This gives us a measure of how different the predicted distribution is from the true distribution.

Once we have calculated the cross-entropy, we can use it as the loss function to optimize our model. The goal is to minimize the cross-entropy, which means that our model is getting better at predicting the true labels.

In summary, computing the loss using cross-entropy between targets and logits is a common technique in machine learning for measuring the difference between the predicted and true distributions. By minimizing the cross-entropy, we can improve the accuracy of our model.

Computing pAE: Multiply probabilities by bin centers and sum to obtain the expected positional error per residue pair, with values $\in[0.25,31.75]$.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of computing pAE, or positional error per residue pair, in the field of bioinformatics.

First, let's define some key terms. In bioinformatics, a residue pair refers to two amino acids in a protein sequence that are adjacent to each other. Positional error refers to the difference between the predicted and actual position of a residue pair in a protein structure.

Now, let's dive into the concept of computing pAE. The formula for computing pAE involves multiplying probabilities by bin centers and then summing the results. The probabilities refer to the likelihood of a residue pair being in a certain position in a protein structure, while the bin centers represent the midpoint of each bin in a histogram of positional errors.

The resulting value of pAE is a measure of the expected positional error per residue pair, with values ranging from 0.25 to 31.75. A lower value of pAE indicates a more accurate prediction of the position of a residue pair in a protein structure.

In summary, computing pAE is a useful tool in bioinformatics for evaluating the accuracy of predicted protein structures. By understanding the key terms and concepts involved, we can better interpret and utilize the results of pAE calculations. Thank you for watching!###

Computing pTM: Additionally, the pairwise logits are used to compute the pTM (Predicted Template Modeling) score, as follows:
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on computing pTM scores. In this video, we will be discussing the concept of pTM scores and how they are computed.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those who are not familiar with this field.

Pairwise logits refer to the log-odds of two sequences being homologous, or having a common ancestor. These logits are calculated by comparing the sequence of interest to a set of known homologous sequences.

Now, let's move on to the concept of pTM scores. pTM stands for Predicted Template Modeling, and it is a measure of how well a given sequence aligns with a set of known homologous sequences. The pTM score is calculated using the pairwise logits of the sequence of interest and the known homologous sequences.

To compute the pTM score, we first calculate the pairwise logits for the sequence of interest and each of the known homologous sequences. We then take the average of these logits to get the pTM score.

In summary, the pTM score is a measure of how well a given sequence aligns with a set of known homologous sequences, and it is calculated using the pairwise logits of the sequence of interest and the known homologous sequences.

Thank you for watching this video on computing pTM scores. We hope you found it helpful!

(a) Compute $f_{d}$ for sequence length $L$ as:
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the computation of $f_{d}$ for a sequence length of $L$. Now, before we dive into the computation, let's first define what $f_{d}$ is. $f_{d}$ is a parameter that is commonly used in signal processing and is known as the Doppler frequency. It is a measure of the frequency shift that occurs when a source of waves, such as sound or light, is moving relative to an observer. In the context of our sequence length $L$, we can think of $f_{d}$ as the frequency shift that occurs when the sequence is shifted by a certain amount. Now, let's move on to the computation of $f_{d}$. To compute $f_{d}$ for a sequence length of $L$, we need to first define the shift amount, which we will denote as $s$. The shift amount is the number of positions that the sequence is shifted by. Once we have defined $s$, we can then use the following formula to compute $f_{d}$:

$f_{d} = \frac{s}{L}$

This formula tells us that $f_{d}$ is equal to the shift amount $s$ divided by the sequence length $L$. So, for example, if we have a sequence length of $L = 10$ and we shift the sequence by $s = 3$ positions, then we can compute $f_{d}$ as follows:

$f_{d} = \frac{3}{10} = 0.3$

So, in this case, the Doppler frequency $f_{d}$ is 0.3. I hope this explanation has been helpful in understanding the computation of $f_{d}$ for a sequence length of $L$. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them in the comments section below. Thank you for watching!

\begin{aligned}
d_{0} & =1.24 \cdot(\max (L, 19)-15)^{\frac{1}{3}}-1.8 \\
f_{d} & =\frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{\text { bins }}{d_{0}}\right)^{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference used by experts in the field. The reference is related to the calculation of a parameter called "d0" and another parameter called "fd".

Let's start with "d0". This parameter is calculated using the formula:

$$
d_{0} =1.24 \cdot(\max (L, 19)-15)^{\frac{1}{3}}-1.8
$$

Here, "L" refers to the length of the object being measured, and "max" means the maximum value between "L" and 19. The value of 19 is used as a cutoff, as objects with lengths shorter than 19 are not considered in this calculation. The formula then calculates the cube root of the difference between the maximum value and 15, and multiplies it by 1.24. Finally, 1.8 is subtracted from the result to obtain the value of "d0".

Now let's move on to "fd". This parameter is calculated using the formula:

$$
f_{d} =\frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{\text { bins }}{d_{0}}\right)^{2}}
$$

Here, "bins" refers to the number of bins used in the measurement process. The formula calculates the inverse of the square of the ratio of "bins" to "d0", and then adds 1 to the result. The final value of "fd" is then obtained by dividing 1 by the result of this calculation.

In summary, "d0" and "fd" are parameters used in the measurement process of objects, and their values are calculated using the formulas we just discussed. We hope this explanation has been helpful to you. Thank you for watching!###

(b) Compute $\mathrm{pTM}$ using previously computed probabilities $p$ :
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on computing the probability of a transition matrix, or pTM, using previously computed probabilities.

First, let's define what a transition matrix is. A transition matrix is a matrix that describes the probability of transitioning from one state to another in a Markov chain. A Markov chain is a stochastic process where the probability of an event depends only on the state of the system at the previous time step.

Now, let's define what pTM is. pTM is the probability of a transition matrix, which is the probability of transitioning from one state to another in a Markov chain.

To compute pTM using previously computed probabilities, we need to use the following formula:

pTM = (1 - p) * p

Where p is the probability of staying in the same state, and (1 - p) is the probability of transitioning to a different state.

For example, if we have a Markov chain with two states, A and B, and we know that the probability of staying in state A is 0.8, and the probability of transitioning to state B is 0.2, we can compute the pTM as follows:

pTM = (1 - 0.8) * 0.2 = 0.4

So the probability of transitioning from state A to state B is 0.4.

I hope this explanation has been helpful. If you have any questions or comments, please leave them in the comments section below. Thank you for watching!###
==============================
$$
\mathrm{pTM}=\max _{i}\left[\frac{1}{L} \sum_{j}\left(\sum_{\text {bin }}[p]_{i, j, \text { bin }}\left[f_{d}\right]_{\text {bin }}\right)\right]
$$
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of pTM and its significance in the field of [insert field here].

First, let's break down the equation. pTM stands for "probability of target match" and is a measure of how likely it is that a particular sequence of DNA or RNA will match a target sequence. The equation itself is a bit complex, so let's go through each term one by one.

$\max _{i}$ refers to the maximum value of a function over a range of values for the variable $i$. In this case, we are looking for the maximum value of pTM over all possible values of $i$.

$\frac{1}{L}$ is simply a normalization factor that ensures that the sum of probabilities over all possible values of $i$ is equal to 1.

$\sum_{j}$ is a summation over all possible values of $j$, which represents the position of the target sequence within the larger sequence being analyzed.

$\left(\sum_{\text {bin }}[p]_{i, j, \text { bin }}\left[f_{d}\right]_{\text {bin }}\right)$ is the most complex part of the equation. Here, we are summing over all possible "bins" or regions of the sequence being analyzed. Within each bin, we are multiplying the probability of a match between the target sequence and the sequence being analyzed ($[p]_{i, j, \text { bin }}$) by a factor ($[f_{d}]_{\text {bin }}$) that takes into account the specific properties of the DNA or RNA being analyzed.

Finally, we take the maximum value of this sum over all possible values of $i$ to get our final value of pTM.

So why is pTM important? Well, it is a key metric used in many applications of DNA and RNA analysis, such as gene editing, disease diagnosis, and forensic analysis. By understanding the probability of a match between a target sequence and a larger sequence being analyzed, researchers and practitioners can make more informed decisions about how to proceed with their analysis.

We hope this explanation has been helpful in understanding the concept of pTM. If you have any further questions or would like to learn more about this topic, please feel free to leave a comment below or reach out to us directly. Thank you for watching!###

We evaluate the reconstruction quality of the structure tokenizer after stage 1 and stage 2 of training using a set of CAMEO, CASP14, and CASP15 proteins taken after the training cutoff date (Fig. S3). Both decoders consistently reach RMSD $<1 \AA$, LDDT-CA $>0.98$. The retraining of the structure token decoder results in substantial improvements in reconstruction quality across all test sets. The stage 2 decoder, trained with an all-atom reconstruction loss and a sequence input, achieves strong all-atom reconstruction as well (Fig. S3C). We also visualize a random sample of backbone reconstructions on the CAMEO test set (Fig. S4A). Looking at the proteins with worse reconstruction quality, we find that long regions with few tertiary contacts, disordered regions, and unresolved coordinates can lead to inaccurate global orientation of structural elements, while local structure reconstruction remains largely error-free (Fig. S4B). This behavior can be explained by the fact that the tokenizer relies on tertiary contacts to resolve the global orientation of a residue.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the reconstruction quality of the structure tokenizer after stage 1 and stage 2 of training. We will be using a set of CAMEO, CASP14, and CASP15 proteins taken after the training cutoff date.

First, let's define some terms. RMSD stands for root mean square deviation, which is a measure of the average distance between the atoms in two structures. LDDT-CA stands for local distance difference test for C-alpha atoms, which is a measure of the structural similarity between two proteins.

Now, let's talk about the results. Both decoders consistently reach RMSD $<1 \AA$, LDDT-CA $>0.98$. This means that the structure tokenizer is able to accurately reconstruct the protein structures with high structural similarity to the original structures.

Furthermore, the retraining of the structure token decoder results in substantial improvements in reconstruction quality across all test sets. This means that the structure tokenizer is able to learn from its mistakes and improve its performance over time.

The stage 2 decoder, trained with an all-atom reconstruction loss and a sequence input, achieves strong all-atom reconstruction as well. This means that the structure tokenizer is able to accurately predict the positions of all atoms in the protein structure.

We also visualize a random sample of backbone reconstructions on the CAMEO test set. Looking at the proteins with worse reconstruction quality, we find that long regions with few tertiary contacts, disordered regions, and unresolved coordinates can lead to inaccurate global orientation of structural elements, while local structure reconstruction remains largely error-free. This behavior can be explained by the fact that the tokenizer relies on tertiary contacts to resolve the global orientation of a residue.

In conclusion, the structure tokenizer is a powerful tool for accurately reconstructing protein structures, and its performance can be improved through retraining and the use of all-atom reconstruction loss. However, there are still some limitations to its performance, particularly in regions with few tertiary contacts or unresolved coordinates.

We also investigate the vocabulary learned by the structure tokenizer by visualizing the local neighborhoods which map to the same learned structure token. We find that many structure tokens encode semantically coherent sets of local neighborhoods (Fig. S5A). However, a number of tokens appear to represent multiple local neighborhoods (Fig. S5B). While the meaning of a single token may be ambiguous, the high-fidelity reconstruction quality from the decoder suggests that it is able to disambiguate given surrounding context in the full set of structure tokens.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a recent study on the vocabulary learned by the structure tokenizer. In this study, the researchers visualized the local neighborhoods that map to the same learned structure token. They found that many structure tokens encode semantically coherent sets of local neighborhoods. This means that the structure tokens are able to group together similar local neighborhoods based on their meaning.

However, the researchers also found that some structure tokens appear to represent multiple local neighborhoods. This means that a single structure token may have multiple meanings, which could be confusing for someone who is not familiar with the field.

Despite this ambiguity, the researchers found that the decoder is able to disambiguate the meaning of the structure tokens given the surrounding context in the full set of structure tokens. This means that the decoder is able to accurately reconstruct the original input based on the structure tokens, even if some of the tokens have multiple meanings.

Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the vocabulary learned by the structure tokenizer and how it can be used to accurately represent and reconstruct complex data. Thank you for watching!

Fig. S6 indicates that pLDDT and pTM are well-calibrated. We assess the calibration of the structure confidence heads on the CAMEO test set using structure tokens predicted by ESM3 7B. Most predictions for pLDDT lie along the diagonal, though there is a small bias towards more confident predictions. As pTM is a pessimistic estimator of the TMscore, we find that pTM is biased downwards. Anecdotally, we also find that pLDDT can be poorly calibrated for some generated sequences, particularly in alpha helical regions where it can be an overestimate.

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the calibration of pLDDT and pTM in the field of protein structure prediction.

First, let's define some terms. pLDDT stands for predicted local distance difference test, which is a measure of the accuracy of a predicted protein structure. pTM stands for predicted TM-score, which is a measure of the similarity between two protein structures.

Now, let's dive into the results presented in Fig. S6. The study found that pLDDT and pTM are well-calibrated, meaning that the predicted values are accurate and reliable. This is important because it allows researchers to have confidence in the accuracy of their predicted protein structures.

The study also assessed the calibration of the structure confidence heads on the CAMEO test set using structure tokens predicted by ESM3 7B. This means that they used a specific dataset and prediction method to evaluate the accuracy of their predictions.

Most predictions for pLDDT lie along the diagonal, which indicates that the predicted values are accurate. However, there is a small bias towards more confident predictions, meaning that the predicted values tend to be slightly higher than the actual values.

As for pTM, the study found that it is a pessimistic estimator of the TMscore, meaning that it tends to underestimate the similarity between two protein structures. This is important to keep in mind when interpreting pTM values.

Finally, the study found that pLDDT can be poorly calibrated for some generated sequences, particularly in alpha helical regions where it can be an overestimate. This means that researchers should be cautious when interpreting pLDDT values for these types of sequences.

In conclusion, the study found that pLDDT and pTM are well-calibrated, but researchers should be aware of potential biases and limitations when interpreting these values. Thank you for watching!

ESM3 processes annotations of functional characteristics of proteins through two tracks: function tokens, and residue annotations. Both support input conditioning and output heads for generation. Appendix A.1.5.1 outlines how tokens are processed into the network: we further describe the creation of the tokens themselves in this section.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the ESM3 process for annotating functional characteristics of proteins. This process involves two tracks: function tokens and residue annotations.

Let's start with function tokens. These are essentially labels that describe the function of a protein. For example, a protein may have a function token of "enzyme" or "transporter". These tokens are used to help categorize and understand the role of different proteins in biological processes.

Now, let's move on to residue annotations. These are annotations that describe specific amino acid residues within a protein. For example, a residue annotation may indicate that a particular amino acid is involved in binding to a specific molecule.

Both function tokens and residue annotations are processed through the ESM3 network. This network is designed to take in input data and generate output based on that data. In the case of protein annotation, the input data would be the sequence of amino acids that make up the protein.

The ESM3 network is able to process this input data through a series of steps outlined in Appendix A.1.5.1. This involves breaking down the protein sequence into smaller segments and then processing those segments through the network.

Overall, the ESM3 process is a powerful tool for annotating the functional characteristics of proteins. By using function tokens and residue annotations, researchers can gain a better understanding of the role that different proteins play in biological processes.

Function tokens are a dense semantic representation of functional characteristics of proteins derived from free-text descriptions of the InterPro and Gene Ontology (GO) terms at each residue. At training time, function tokens are produced from each protein's InterPro annotations by a multi-step process illustrated in Fig. S7. At a high level:
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on function tokens. Function tokens are a type of semantic representation that is used to describe the functional characteristics of proteins. They are derived from free-text descriptions of InterPro and Gene Ontology (GO) terms at each residue.

InterPro is a database that provides functional analysis of protein sequences by classifying them into families and predicting domains and important sites. Gene Ontology (GO) is a database that provides a standardized vocabulary to describe the functions of genes and their products in any organism.

To create function tokens, a multi-step process is used. This process is illustrated in Fig. S7. At a high level, the process involves extracting relevant information from the InterPro and GO annotations for each protein. This information is then used to generate a set of function tokens that describe the functional characteristics of the protein.

Function tokens are a dense representation of the functional characteristics of proteins. This means that they provide a compact and efficient way to describe the functions of proteins. They are particularly useful for tasks such as protein classification and prediction of protein-protein interactions.

In summary, function tokens are a type of semantic representation that is used to describe the functional characteristics of proteins. They are derived from free-text descriptions of InterPro and Gene Ontology (GO) terms at each residue, and are generated using a multi-step process. Function tokens are a dense representation of protein function, and are useful for a variety of tasks in protein analysis.

1. For each residue, we gather free-text for each InterPro annotation via annotation term names, associated GO terms per annotation (via InterPro2GO mapping), and all ancestor GO terms. We parse the free-text into counts from a vocabulary of 68,103 keywords. The vocabulary is composed of unigram and bigrams extracted from the free-text of all valid InterPro annotations (and their associated GO/ancestor GO terms) in our training datasets.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a script that can be used on YouTube to explain a reference to experts. The reference we will be discussing is related to the field of bioinformatics and specifically, the process of gathering free-text for each InterPro annotation.

To begin, let's define some key terms that may not be obvious to those not specializing in this field. InterPro is a database that provides functional analysis of protein sequences by classifying them into families and predicting domains and important sites. Annotation refers to the process of adding descriptive information to a sequence or protein, such as its function or location within a cell.

Now, let's dive into the script itself. For each residue, which refers to a specific amino acid in a protein sequence, we gather free-text for each InterPro annotation. Free-text refers to any text that is not structured or formatted in a specific way, such as notes or comments. Annotation term names are the specific terms used to describe the function or location of a protein sequence.

Next, we use InterPro2GO mapping to associate GO terms per annotation. GO terms, or Gene Ontology terms, are a standardized vocabulary used to describe the function of genes and proteins. Ancestor GO terms refer to the more general terms that a specific GO term is a part of.

Finally, we parse the free-text into counts from a vocabulary of 68,103 keywords. This vocabulary is composed of unigram and bigrams extracted from the free-text of all valid InterPro annotations (and their associated GO/ancestor GO terms) in our training datasets. Unigrams are single words, while bigrams are pairs of words that often occur together.

In summary, this script is used to gather and analyze free-text for each InterPro annotation, using annotation term names, associated GO terms, and ancestor GO terms to create a vocabulary of keywords that can be used for further analysis.

2. The keywords are converted to a sparse TF-IDF vector per InterPro annotation. During training, we also produce a corrupted version by dropping keywords at the protein level (i.e. the same keywords have their counts set to 0 across all residues) at a $15 \%$ probability per keyword.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference related to the field of bioinformatics. In this reference, the authors have developed a method to convert keywords into a sparse TF-IDF vector per InterPro annotation.

Let's break down what each of these terms means.

First, keywords refer to specific words or phrases that are relevant to the topic being discussed. In this case, the keywords are related to InterPro annotations, which are a set of protein families and domains that are used to classify proteins based on their function.

Next, TF-IDF stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency. This is a statistical method used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a corpus. In this case, the authors are using TF-IDF to convert the keywords into a vector representation that can be used for further analysis.

The term "sparse" refers to the fact that the vector representation of the keywords will have many zero values. This is because not all keywords will be relevant to every protein family or domain.

Finally, the authors mention that they produce a corrupted version of the vector by dropping keywords at the protein level. This means that they randomly remove some of the keywords from the vector representation, which can help to improve the robustness of their method.

Overall, this reference describes a method for converting keywords into a vector representation that can be used for further analysis in the field of bioinformatics. By using TF-IDF and producing a sparse vector representation, the authors are able to efficiently analyze large amounts of data related to protein families and domains.
==============================
3. To create a vector per residue from the per annotation vectors, we max pool the TF-IDF vectors for the annotations per residue. During training, we further corrupt the "corrupted" version by dropping annotations at the protein level (i.e. the same annotations are removed from the max pool across all residues) at a $15 \%$ probability per annotation.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference to experts in the field of protein annotation. In this reference, the authors propose a method to create a vector per residue from the per annotation vectors. This is done by max pooling the TF-IDF vectors for the annotations per residue.

Let's break down some of the terms used in this reference. TF-IDF stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency. This is a statistical technique used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a corpus. In the context of protein annotation, the authors are using TF-IDF to evaluate the importance of each annotation for each residue.

Max pooling is a technique used in machine learning to combine multiple feature maps into a single feature map. In this reference, the authors are using max pooling to combine the TF-IDF vectors for each annotation per residue.

During training, the authors further corrupt the "corrupted" version by dropping annotations at the protein level. This means that they remove the same annotations from the max pool across all residues at a 15% probability per annotation. This is done to introduce some noise into the data and prevent overfitting.

In summary, the authors propose a method to create a vector per residue from the per annotation vectors by max pooling the TF-IDF vectors for the annotations per residue. During training, they further corrupt the data by dropping annotations at the protein level to prevent overfitting.

4. We then quantize each residue's vector (a highly sparse vector with float entries) into a discrete representation suitable for input to the language model as tokens by applying a fixed series of 8 locality sensitive hashes $(\mathrm{LSH})$, each with 8 hyperplanes.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference to experts in the field of machine learning. Specifically, we will be looking at the process of quantizing each residue's vector into a discrete representation suitable for input to the language model as tokens.

To begin, let's define some of the terms used in this reference. A residue is a type of amino acid that is found in proteins. In the context of machine learning, we can represent each residue as a vector with float entries. This vector contains information about the residue's properties, such as its size, charge, and hydrophobicity.

Now, let's move on to the process of quantization. Quantization is the process of converting a continuous variable into a discrete variable. In this case, we are quantizing each residue's vector into a discrete representation suitable for input to the language model as tokens.

To do this, we apply a fixed series of 8 locality sensitive hashes (LSH). LSH is a technique used in machine learning to find similar items in a dataset. It works by hashing each item into a fixed number of buckets, where similar items are more likely to be hashed into the same bucket.

In this case, we are using 8 LSH functions, each with 8 hyperplanes. A hyperplane is a mathematical concept that separates a space into two regions. In the context of LSH, each hyperplane is used to separate the residues into different buckets based on their properties.

By applying these 8 LSH functions, we can convert each residue's vector into a discrete representation suitable for input to the language model as tokens. This allows us to train our machine learning model to recognize patterns in the data and make predictions based on that information.

In conclusion, quantizing each residue's vector into a discrete representation suitable for input to the language model as tokens is an important step in the process of machine learning. By using LSH functions, we can convert continuous variables into discrete variables, making it easier to train our model and make accurate predictions.
==============================
The result is a sequence of 8 tokens each ranging in value from 0 to 255 per-residue. We reserve a special token <none> to represent positions with an empty set of InterPro annotations. For proteins that lack any functional annotations, the tokens are filled with the $<$ pad> token which has an embedding value fixed to all zeros. At test time, we can produce per residue vectors using the process described, or directly creating a TF-IDF vector with keywords.

In this reference, we are discussing a sequence of 8 tokens that range in value from 0 to 255 per-residue. These tokens are used to represent positions with an empty set of InterPro annotations.

InterPro is a database that provides functional analysis of proteins by classifying them into families and predicting domains and important sites. It is a widely used resource in the field of bioinformatics.

Now, let's talk about the special token <none>. This token is used to represent positions with an empty set of InterPro annotations. This means that there are no known functional annotations for that particular position in the protein sequence.

For proteins that lack any functional annotations, the tokens are filled with the $<$ pad> token. This token has an embedding value fixed to all zeros. Embedding is a technique used in natural language processing and machine learning to represent words as vectors of real numbers. In this case, the $<$ pad> token is used to fill in the gaps where there are no functional annotations.

Finally, we can produce per-residue vectors using the process described, or directly creating a TF-IDF vector with keywords. TF-IDF stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency. It is a statistical technique used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a corpus. In this case, we are using it to evaluate the importance of functional annotations for each position in the protein sequence.

In summary, this reference is discussing a sequence of tokens used to represent functional annotations for protein sequences. The special token <none> is used to represent positions with no known annotations, and the $<$ pad> token is used to fill in the gaps. Finally, we can use TF-IDF vectors to evaluate the importance of functional annotations for each position in the protein sequence.

During pre-training we use the corrupted versions of the function tokens at input, predicting the un-corrupted version function tokens at positions which have been masked. $90 \%$ of the time, the entire input is replaced with $<$ mask $>$. The other $10 \%$ of the time, we replace all 8 tokens of selected residue with a $<$ mask $>$, with the per-residue selection probability sampled from a cosine masking schedule per protein. The model has an output head which predicts each of the 8 function tokens in positions with $<$ mask $>$ as input, and is trained with a categorical cross entropy loss
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on pre-training for function token prediction. In this video, we will be discussing the process of pre-training and how it is used to predict function tokens.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those not specializing in this field. Function tokens are essentially labels that describe the function of a protein. These labels can be predicted using machine learning algorithms.

During pre-training, we use corrupted versions of the function tokens at input. This means that we intentionally introduce errors or noise into the input data to make it more challenging for the model to predict the correct function tokens.

To do this, we predict the un-corrupted version of the function tokens at positions that have been masked. This means that we hide certain parts of the input data and ask the model to predict what those hidden parts should be.

We use a masking schedule to determine which parts of the input data to hide. In this case, we use a cosine masking schedule per protein. This means that we gradually increase the amount of masking over time, starting with a small amount and gradually increasing it until we reach a certain threshold.

The model has an output head which predicts each of the 8 function tokens in positions with "<mask>" as input. This means that the model is trained to predict the correct function tokens even when some parts of the input data are missing or corrupted.

Finally, we train the model using a categorical cross entropy loss. This is a type of loss function that is commonly used in machine learning to measure the difference between predicted and actual values.

In summary, pre-training is a technique used to improve the accuracy of function token prediction by introducing noise and errors into the input data. By using a masking schedule and a categorical cross entropy loss, we can train the model to predict the correct function tokens even when some parts of the input data are missing or corrupted.

Function tokenization offers several key advantages as compared to simpler approaches for example using a dedicated InterPro tag vocabulary. Encoding functional annotations with a generic functional keyword vocabulary enables flexible prompting of the model at test time, by combinations of keywords that were not encountered during training time. This enhances the programmability of ESM3 in designing novel proteins with not previously observed functional characteristics.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on function tokenization and its advantages over simpler approaches.

Function tokenization is a technique used in natural language processing to break down text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens are then used to represent the functional annotations of a protein.

One of the key advantages of function tokenization is that it allows for the use of a generic functional keyword vocabulary. This means that instead of using a dedicated InterPro tag vocabulary, which can be limiting, function tokenization allows for a more flexible approach.

By encoding functional annotations with a generic functional keyword vocabulary, it becomes possible to prompt the model at test time with combinations of keywords that were not encountered during training time. This enhances the programmability of ESM3, which is a deep learning model used in designing novel proteins with not previously observed functional characteristics.

In summary, function tokenization offers several key advantages over simpler approaches, including the use of a generic functional keyword vocabulary and enhanced programmability of ESM3. This makes it a powerful tool for designing novel proteins with unique functional characteristics.

Function tokenization can also be viewed through the lens of data compression. This choice of representation reduces the input/output space from all possible InterPro combinations which would naively be represented by $35 \mathrm{k}$ bits, to a reduced space of 8 tokens $\times 8$ bits $/$ token $=64$ bits. This also affords significant memory saving during pre-training by eliminating the need to perform multi-class multi-label binary classification.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on function tokenization and data compression. In this video, we will be discussing how function tokenization can be viewed through the lens of data compression.

First, let's define some terms. Function tokenization is the process of representing a function as a sequence of tokens. These tokens are essentially smaller, more manageable pieces of information that can be used to represent the function as a whole.

Data compression, on the other hand, is the process of reducing the size of a file or data set without losing any important information. This is often done to save storage space or to make it easier to transmit data over a network.

Now, let's talk about how function tokenization can be used for data compression. When we tokenize a function, we are essentially reducing the amount of information needed to represent that function. This is because we are breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

For example, let's say we have a function that can take on 35,000 different values. If we were to represent this function using all possible combinations of InterPro, we would need 35,000 bits of information. However, if we tokenize the function and represent it using 8 tokens, we only need 8 tokens times 8 bits per token, which equals 64 bits.

This reduction in the amount of information needed to represent the function is a form of data compression. By tokenizing the function, we are able to represent it using fewer bits of information, which saves storage space and makes it easier to transmit the data.

In addition, this approach also eliminates the need to perform multi-class multi-label binary classification during pre-training. This is because the tokens themselves can be used to represent the different classes and labels, without the need for additional classification.

Overall, function tokenization is a powerful tool for data compression and can be used to reduce the amount of information needed to represent complex functions. By breaking down the function into smaller, more manageable pieces, we can save storage space and make it easier to transmit the data.

ESM3 is trained to predict all 8 function tokens, each spanning 256 possible values. To extract interpretable predictions of protein function from ESM3 we decode the predicted function tokens into function keywords using a seperately trained function token decoder.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the use of ESM3 in predicting protein function.

ESM3 is a deep learning model that has been trained to predict all 8 function tokens, each spanning 256 possible values. This means that ESM3 is capable of predicting the function of a protein based on its amino acid sequence.

To extract interpretable predictions of protein function from ESM3, we use a separately trained function token decoder. This decoder takes the predicted function tokens and converts them into function keywords.

Let's break down some of the terms used in this explanation.

Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn and make predictions.

A function token is a unit of information that represents a specific function or activity of a protein.

A function keyword is a word or phrase that describes a specific function or activity of a protein.

Amino acid sequence refers to the specific order of amino acids that make up a protein.

In summary, ESM3 is a deep learning model that has been trained to predict the function of a protein based on its amino acid sequence. To extract interpretable predictions of protein function from ESM3, we use a separately trained function token decoder that converts the predicted function tokens into function keywords.

We train a 3-layer transformer model to learn the inverse map of the function tokenization process. The model takes as input the 8 function tokens representing the locality sensitive hash of function keywords. It outputs for each residue the binary-classification predictions predicting the presence of each function keyword, as well as predicting InterPro annotations from which the keywords originate. We find that unpacking the 8-bit LSH tokens into single-bit tokens improves training dynamics of the function token decoder. We train the function token decoder offline using combinations of InterPro tags from the UniRef annotated proteins. Since the function token vocabulary is fixed the decoder is applied identically across different ESM3 model sizes.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a recent development in the field of protein function prediction. In this study, the researchers have developed a 3-layer transformer model to learn the inverse map of the function tokenization process.

Now, let's break down some of the technical terms used in this statement. First, a transformer model is a type of neural network architecture that is particularly effective at processing sequential data, such as text or protein sequences. It consists of an encoder and decoder, where the encoder processes the input data and the decoder generates the output.

Next, the function tokenization process refers to the process of converting protein sequences into a set of function tokens. These tokens are essentially binary vectors that represent the presence or absence of specific protein functions.

The researchers have used a locality sensitive hash (LSH) function to generate these function tokens. LSH is a technique used to efficiently search for similar items in large datasets. In this case, it is used to group similar protein sequences together based on their function.

The 8-bit LSH tokens refer to the binary vectors generated by the LSH function. These tokens are then used as input to the transformer model.

The function token decoder is the part of the transformer model that takes the LSH tokens as input and generates the binary-classification predictions for the presence of each function keyword. It also predicts InterPro annotations, which are a set of protein domains and functional sites that are commonly found in proteins.

Finally, the researchers have found that unpacking the 8-bit LSH tokens into single-bit tokens improves the training dynamics of the function token decoder. This means that by breaking down the LSH tokens into smaller units, the model is able to learn more effectively.

Overall, this study represents an important step forward in the field of protein function prediction. By using a transformer model to learn the inverse map of the function tokenization process, the researchers have developed a powerful tool for predicting protein functions.

To evaluate ESM3's performance in predicting protein function, we compute Average Precision, a standard measure of information retrieval, using the validation set of proteins from the UniRef and their associated InterProScan function annotations. We present results in Fig. S8.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing how to evaluate the performance of ESM3 in predicting protein function.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those not specializing in this field.

ESM3 stands for Evolutionary Scale Modeling 3, which is a deep learning model that predicts protein structures and functions.

UniRef is a database of protein sequences that have been clustered into groups based on their sequence similarity.

InterProScan is a tool that predicts protein function based on the presence of protein domains and motifs.

Now, let's talk about how we evaluate ESM3's performance. We use a standard measure of information retrieval called Average Precision. This measure takes into account both the precision and recall of the predictions.

To compute Average Precision, we use the validation set of proteins from the UniRef database and their associated InterProScan function annotations. This means that we compare the predicted functions of the proteins using ESM3 to the actual functions annotated by InterProScan.

The results of this evaluation are presented in Fig. S8, which shows the Average Precision of ESM3's predictions for different levels of function annotation.

In summary, we use Average Precision to evaluate ESM3's performance in predicting protein function, and we compare its predictions to the actual functions annotated by InterProScan using the validation set of proteins from the UniRef database.

The vast majority of structures have near perfect backbone reconstruction (B) A selection of the worst reconstructions in CAMEO. Long stretches of disordered regions, a lack of tertiary contacts, and unresolved coordinates can lead to inaccurate global orientation of structural elements, while local structure reconstruction remains largely error-free.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the topic of structure tokenizer backbone reconstructions. This is a complex topic, so we will be breaking it down into simple terms that anyone can understand.

First, let's define what a structure tokenizer is. A structure tokenizer is a tool used in the field of structural biology to analyze and compare protein structures. It works by breaking down the structure into smaller, more manageable parts called tokens.

Now, let's move on to the term "backbone reconstruction." The backbone of a protein is the chain of amino acids that make up the protein's structure. Backbone reconstruction refers to the process of predicting the 3D structure of a protein based on its amino acid sequence.

In the context of the structure tokenizer, backbone reconstruction refers to the accuracy of the predicted 3D structure of a protein based on the tokens generated by the tool.

Figure S4 shows a random sample of reconstructions from the structure tokenizer on the CAMEO test set. The vast majority of structures have near perfect backbone reconstruction. This means that the predicted 3D structure of the protein is very accurate.

However, there are some cases where the backbone reconstruction is not as accurate. This can be due to a variety of factors, such as long stretches of disordered regions, a lack of tertiary contacts, and unresolved coordinates. These factors can lead to inaccurate global orientation of structural elements, while local structure reconstruction remains largely error-free.

In summary, the structure tokenizer is a tool used in structural biology to analyze and compare protein structures. Backbone reconstruction refers to the accuracy of the predicted 3D structure of a protein based on the tokens generated by the tool. While the vast majority of structures have near perfect backbone reconstruction, there are some cases where the accuracy is not as high due to various factors.

The VQ-VAE encoder reasons over local structure neighborhoods (highlighted in red) which include the query residue and the 15 nearest neighbors in structure space. (A) Rows correspond to token indices 585,59 , and 3692 for top, middle, and bottom, respectively. Columns show different local structures mapping to the same token. (B) Some tokens represent multiple types of local neighborhoods. All local neighborhoods in B map to the same codebook index 3276. While the meaning of a single token may be ambiguous, the decoder is able to disambiguate given surrounding context in the full sequence of structure tokens.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of local neighborhoods in the context of VQ-VAE encoders.

First, let's define some terms. VQ-VAE stands for Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder. This is a type of neural network that is used for unsupervised learning of representations of data. In this case, we are specifically looking at protein structures.

Now, let's talk about local neighborhoods. In the context of protein structures, a local neighborhood refers to a small region of the protein that includes the query residue and the 15 nearest neighbors in structure space. These neighbors are determined based on their distance from the query residue in the protein structure.

The VQ-VAE encoder is able to reason over these local neighborhoods by mapping them to a learned structure token. This means that the encoder is able to identify patterns in the local neighborhoods and assign them a unique codebook index.

In Figure S5, we can see an example of how different local neighborhoods can map to the same learned structure token. The rows correspond to different tokens, while the columns show different local structures that map to the same token.

It's important to note that some tokens can represent multiple types of local neighborhoods. This means that the decoder must be able to disambiguate the meaning of the token based on the surrounding context in the full sequence of structure tokens.

Overall, the concept of local neighborhoods and VQ-VAE encoders is an important tool for understanding protein structures and their interactions. By identifying patterns in local neighborhoods, we can gain insights into the function and behavior of proteins.

Figure S6. pTM and pLDDT calibration. Calibration of the structure token decoder pLDDT and pTM (using ESM3 7B as the structure token prediction model) on the CAMEO test set.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the calibration of the structure token decoder pLDDT and pTM using the CAMEO test set.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those not specializing in this field.

pLDDT stands for predicted local distance difference test. It is a measure of the accuracy of a protein structure prediction model. It compares the predicted structure to the actual structure and calculates the difference in distance between corresponding atoms.

pTM stands for predicted torsion angle. It is another measure of the accuracy of a protein structure prediction model. It compares the predicted structure to the actual structure and calculates the difference in torsion angles between corresponding atoms.

ESM3 7B is a structure token prediction model. It is a machine learning model that predicts the structure of a protein based on its amino acid sequence.

The CAMEO test set is a dataset of protein structures that is used to evaluate the accuracy of protein structure prediction models.

Now, let's discuss the calibration of the structure token decoder pLDDT and pTM using the CAMEO test set.

The structure token decoder is a component of the protein structure prediction model that converts the predicted structure tokens into a 3D structure. The calibration of the structure token decoder involves adjusting its parameters to improve the accuracy of the predicted structure.

The calibration was performed using the CAMEO test set. The predicted structure tokens were generated using the ESM3 7B model. The predicted structures were then compared to the actual structures in the CAMEO test set using the pLDDT and pTM measures.

The results of the calibration showed that the structure token decoder was able to accurately predict the structure of proteins using the ESM3 7B model. The pLDDT and pTM measures were used to evaluate the accuracy of the predicted structures and to adjust the parameters of the structure token decoder to improve its accuracy.

In conclusion, the calibration of the structure token decoder pLDDT and pTM using the CAMEO test set is an important step in improving the accuracy of protein structure prediction models. By using the pLDDT and pTM measures to evaluate the accuracy of the predicted structures, researchers can adjust the parameters of the structure token decoder to improve its accuracy and ultimately improve our understanding of protein structures.

Figure S7. Schematic of function tokenization. The set of InterPro and GO descriptions of protein function are vectorized by a TF-IDF model and then hashed by a locality sensitive hash to produce 8 tokens each containing 8 bits.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of function tokenization. This is a technique used in the field of bioinformatics to represent protein function in a more efficient and standardized way.

To understand function tokenization, we first need to define some key terms. InterPro and GO are two widely used databases that provide descriptions of protein function. InterPro is a database that integrates protein signatures from various sources to provide functional annotations for proteins. GO, or Gene Ontology, is a database that provides a standardized vocabulary for describing the functions of genes and proteins.

Now, let's move on to the process of function tokenization. The first step is to vectorize the InterPro and GO descriptions of protein function. This means that we convert the text descriptions into numerical vectors that can be processed by a computer.

Next, we use a technique called TF-IDF, or term frequency-inverse document frequency, to weight the importance of each term in the vector. This helps to ensure that the most relevant terms are given more weight in the final representation.

Finally, we use a locality sensitive hash function to produce 8 tokens, each containing 8 bits. A hash function is a mathematical function that takes an input and produces a fixed-size output, or hash. A locality sensitive hash function is a type of hash function that is designed to preserve the similarity between similar inputs.

In the context of function tokenization, the locality sensitive hash function is used to group similar protein functions together based on their vector representations. This allows us to efficiently compare and analyze large sets of protein functions.

In summary, function tokenization is a technique used in bioinformatics to represent protein function in a more efficient and standardized way. It involves vectorizing protein function descriptions, weighting the importance of each term using TF-IDF, and using a locality sensitive hash function to produce 8 tokens, each containing 8 bits.

We report mAP for the full keyword set (red) with a "micro" average because many keywords have few or no labels in the validation set. To report a "macro" average mAP we compute mAP for each of the top 1,000 most prevalent keywords in our evaluation set (discarding uninformative keywords such as "the") and report a uniform average (blue). $95 \%$ confidence intervals are shown by shading.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the results of a function prediction benchmarking study. In this study, we evaluated the performance of a model in predicting function keywords for protein structures.

To understand this study, we need to first define some terms. Mean Average Precision, or mAP, is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a model in predicting the correct labels for a given set of data. In this study, we used mAP to evaluate the model's ability to predict function keywords for protein structures.

Function keywords are specific words or phrases that describe the function of a protein structure. For example, "active site" is a function keyword that describes the location on a protein where a chemical reaction occurs.

In this study, we compared the model's predictions to the actual labels on a per-position basis. This means that we evaluated the model's ability to predict the correct function keyword for each position in the protein structure.

We reported the mAP for the full keyword set, which means that we evaluated the model's performance for all function keywords in the dataset. We also reported a "micro" average, which means that we averaged the mAP scores for all function keywords, regardless of how many labels were available in the validation set.

To report a "macro" average mAP, we computed the mAP for each of the top 1,000 most prevalent keywords in our evaluation set. We discarded uninformative keywords such as "the" and reported a uniform average.

Finally, we showed $95 \%$ confidence intervals by shading to indicate the range of values that the mAP could fall within with a $95 \%$ probability.

In conclusion, this study evaluated the performance of a model in predicting function keywords for protein structures using mAP. We compared the model's predictions to the actual labels on a per-position basis and reported the mAP for the full keyword set and a "macro" average. We hope this explanation has been helpful in understanding the results of this study. Thank you for watching!###

Residue annotations label a protein's sites of functional residues with a vocabulary of 1474 multi-hot labels emitted by InterProScan. To gather this data, we run InterProScan with databases (SFLD, CDD, PIR) on all cluster members in our UniRef and Mgnify datasets (seq-id 90 clustered). We take all unique residue annotation descriptions that occur in more than $1 \mathrm{k}$ proteins across all of UniRef90 and MGnify 90 , and deduplicate labels by punctuation and case insensitivity. We join these annotations into our UniRef, MGnify, AFDB, and ESMAtlas datasets for training.

As introduced in Appendix A.1.5.1, ESM3 has a track dedicated to processing residue annotations that supports input conditioning, and an output head for generation. The residue annotation labels for a protein are tokenized into a sequence of token-sets in length equal to the protein. At each position there is an unordered set of tokens representing the residue annotations present at that position. The tokens are input to ESM3 first through an embedding lookup followed by a sum over embeddings. The permutation invariance of the sum retains that the labels are represented to an unordered set as a model. The per-position embedding sums are then added onto the per-position sequence embedding before input into the first transformer block. Positions with no residue annotations are represented by a <pad> token which has an embedding fixed to zeros.
The residue annotations track has an output head which outputs a set of binary classification logits predicting for each position the presence or absence of each residue annotation in the vocabulary. We apply a masking procedure to partially/fully mask residue annotation labels, and train the output head with a binary cross-entropy loss function to reconstruct the full residue annotation. In pre-training, with $90 \%$ probability all residue annotations are masked, and otherwise we independently sample positions to mask with a square root schedule. The head is trained to predict the presence of any residue annotation label that was masked.

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the residue annotation track in ESM3. ESM3 is a language model that has a dedicated track for processing residue annotations. This track supports input conditioning and an output head for generation.

Residue annotations are labels that describe the properties of amino acids in a protein. These labels are tokenized into a sequence of token-sets, where each set represents the residue annotations present at a particular position in the protein.

The tokens are input to ESM3 through an embedding lookup, which is followed by a sum over embeddings. This sum is permutation invariant, which means that the order of the labels does not matter. The per-position embedding sums are then added onto the per-position sequence embedding before input into the first transformer block.

Positions with no residue annotations are represented by a <pad> token, which has an embedding fixed to zeros.

The residue annotations track has an output head that outputs a set of binary classification logits. These logits predict the presence or absence of each residue annotation in the vocabulary for each position in the protein.

To train the output head, we apply a masking procedure to partially or fully mask residue annotation labels. We then train the output head with a binary cross-entropy loss function to reconstruct the full residue annotation.

In pre-training, we mask $90 \%$ of the residue annotations with a square root schedule. The head is trained to predict the presence of any residue annotation label that was masked.

In summary, the residue annotation track in ESM3 is a powerful tool for processing and generating residue annotations in proteins. It uses an embedding lookup and a sum over embeddings to represent the labels, and an output head to predict their presence or absence. The masking procedure and binary cross-entropy loss function are used to train the output head.

As mentioned in Appendix A.1.5.1, ESM3 has two additional tasks that are only used during pre-training, and only used as input (we do not have output heads predicting these values). The first is a per-residue pLDDT: for ground truth PDB structures, these values are all 1; for AlphaFoldDB/ESMFold structures, we use the provided pLDDT. We also provide an averaged pLDDT across all the residues when structure is provided (1 otherwise), with the average calculated before any tokens are masked.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference related to the field of protein structure prediction. Specifically, we will be discussing the use of per-residue pLDDT in the pre-training of ESM3.

First, let's define some terms. ESM3 stands for Evolutionary Scale Modeling 3, which is a deep learning model used for protein structure prediction. Pre-training refers to the process of training the model on a large dataset before fine-tuning it on a smaller dataset for a specific task.

Now, let's talk about per-residue pLDDT. pLDDT stands for predicted Local Distance Difference Test, which is a measure of the accuracy of a predicted protein structure. It compares the predicted structure to the true structure and calculates the distance between corresponding atoms. A value of 1 indicates a perfect match, while lower values indicate increasing deviation from the true structure.

In the context of ESM3 pre-training, per-residue pLDDT is used as an input feature for the model. For ground truth PDB structures, all values are set to 1 since they are already known to be accurate. For AlphaFoldDB/ESMFold structures, the provided pLDDT values are used.

Additionally, an averaged pLDDT value is provided across all residues when a structure is given. This average is calculated before any tokens are masked, which means that it is calculated using the full sequence of amino acids.

In summary, per-residue pLDDT is a measure of the accuracy of a predicted protein structure, and it is used as an input feature in the pre-training of ESM3. The provided pLDDT values are used for AlphaFoldDB/ESMFold structures, and an averaged pLDDT value is also provided.

This information allows the model to distinguish between gold-standard structures and computationally predicted ones; at inference time, we set these to 1 throughout, with the goal of producing structures better than the computational predictions used to pre-train the model.

------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on using pLDDT values to improve protein structure prediction. In this video, we will be discussing how pLDDT values can be used to distinguish between gold-standard structures and computationally predicted ones, and how this information can be used to produce better protein structures.

First, let's define some terms. Gold-standard structures are protein structures that have been experimentally determined and are considered to be the most accurate representation of the protein's structure. Computationally predicted structures, on the other hand, are structures that have been predicted using computational methods, such as homology modeling or ab initio modeling.

Now, let's talk about pLDDT values. pLDDT stands for predicted local distance difference test, and it is a measure of the accuracy of a protein structure prediction. The pLDDT value ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a more accurate prediction.

In our model, we use pLDDT values to distinguish between gold-standard structures and computationally predicted ones. At inference time, we set these values to 1 throughout, with the goal of producing structures that are better than the computational predictions used to pre-train the model.

The embedding itself is straightforward. We first apply a radial basis function to the pLDDT values, which maps the values to a higher-dimensional space. This allows us to capture more complex relationships between the pLDDT values and the protein structure. We then apply a linear layer to the resulting embeddings, which allows us to make predictions based on the embeddings.

In summary, pLDDT values can be used to distinguish between gold-standard structures and computationally predicted ones, and this information can be used to produce better protein structures. By embedding the pLDDT values in a higher-dimensional space and applying a linear layer, we can capture more complex relationships between the pLDDT values and the protein structure, leading to more accurate predictions.

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the RBF algorithm. RBF stands for Radial Basis Function, which is a type of artificial neural network. In this algorithm, we have a set of inputs $x$ which are in the real number space $\mathbb{R}$. We also have three parameters: $a$ and $b$ which are also in $\mathbb{R}$, and $n$ which is a positive integer in $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$. The first step in the algorithm is to calculate the interval $\Delta$ between $a$ and $b$ by dividing the difference between $a$ and $b$ by $n-1$. This gives us a set of $n$ points $c$ which are evenly spaced between $a$ and $b$. Next, we calculate the standard deviation $\sigma$ by dividing the difference between $a$ and $b$ by $n$. We then use this standard deviation to calculate the distance between each point in $c$ and the input $x$. This distance is then used to calculate the RBF function, which is the exponential of the squared distance. This function is then returned as the output of the algorithm. I hope this explanation has been helpful in understanding the RBF algorithm. If you have any questions or comments, please leave them in the comments section below. Thank you for watching!

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the PLDDT algorithm. PLDDT stands for Predicted Local Distance Difference Test and is a method used in protein structure prediction.

In this algorithm, we have several inputs including $x_{\text {plddt }}$ which is a vector of length $L$ containing values between 0 and 1, and $x_{\text {argplddt }}$ which is a scalar value also between 0 and 1.

The first step in the algorithm is to calculate the radial basis function (RBF) of $x_{\text {plddt }}$. This is done using the RBF function with a width of 1.0 and a standard deviation of 16. The result is a matrix of size $L \times 16$ called $\operatorname{rbf}_{\text {plddt }}$.

Next, we calculate the RBF of $x_{\text {avgplddt }}$ which is the average of $x_{\text {plddt }}$. This results in a matrix of size $16 \times 1$ called $\mathrm{rbf}_{\text {avgplddt }}$.

We then use the Linear function to calculate $z_{\text {avgplddt }}$, which is a vector of size $d$ where $d$ is the number of dimensions in the input data.

Next, we use the Linear function again to calculate $z_{\text {plddt }}$, which is a matrix of size $L \times d$.

Finally, we add $z_{\text {avgplddt }}$ to each row of $z_{\text {plddt }}$ and return the resulting matrix.

In summary, the PLDDT algorithm takes in a vector of values between 0 and 1 and calculates a matrix of size $L \times d$ using the RBF and Linear functions. This matrix is then used in protein structure prediction to determine the accuracy of a predicted protein structure.

The final 30,000 steps in the pre-training of the $98 \mathrm{~B}$ variant of ESM3 includes a track for processing the taxonomic and species classification of the organism from which the protein sequence originates. For each protein, the taxonomic and species classifications are concatenated to create a full taxonomic lineage. The list of terms is then tokenized using a vocabulary comprised of the top 40,000 taxonomic terms in the UniRef training dataset. At input, learned embeddings (dimension 768) for each term in the lineage are summed and projected by a learned linear projection to a single embedding of $d_{\text {model }}$. This low-rank embedding bag saves memory as compared to using full-dimension embeddings. This single embedding is then repeated across the length of the sequence and summed into the positional embeddings with all the other tracks. The linear projection is zero-initialized at the start of this stage of training to preserve model behavior, enabling continuation of pre-training with no degradation in performance.

For each protein, the taxonomic and species classifications are concatenated to create a full taxonomic lineage. This lineage is then tokenized using a vocabulary comprised of the top 40,000 taxonomic terms in the UniRef training dataset.

At input, learned embeddings (dimension 768) for each term in the lineage are summed and projected by a learned linear projection to a single embedding of $d_{\text {model }}$. This low-rank embedding bag saves memory as compared to using full-dimension embeddings.

This single embedding is then repeated across the length of the sequence and summed into the positional embeddings with all the other tracks. The linear projection is zero-initialized at the start of this stage of training to preserve model behavior, enabling continuation of pre-training with no degradation in performance.

In summary, the pre-training of the $98 \mathrm{~B}$ variant of ESM3 includes a track for processing the taxonomic and species classification of the organism from which the protein sequence originates. This is done by concatenating the taxonomic and species classifications to create a full taxonomic lineage, which is then tokenized using a vocabulary comprised of the top 40,000 taxonomic terms in the UniRef training dataset. The learned embeddings for each term in the lineage are then summed and projected by a learned linear projection to a single embedding of $d_{\text {model }}$, which is repeated across the length of the sequence and summed into the positional embeddings with all the other tracks. The linear projection is zero-initialized at the start of this stage of training to preserve model behavior, enabling continuation of pre-training with no degradation in performance.

In pre-training we apply random corruption to the taxonomic lineages and train ESM3 to reconstruct the full lineage by predicting dropped terms with a shallow MLP head trained on the final layer's representations. To corrupt the taxonomic lineage, we either drop all terms (probability 25\%) or drop a set of the most specific terms of the lineage of size chosen uniformly at random from 1 to the length of the lineage (probability $25 \%$ ). We also independently drop any taxonomic term with probability $10 \%$. The output head outputs binary classification logits over the full set of 40,000 taxonomic lineage terms, and is trained to predict the missing terms via a binary-cross entropy loss.

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference to experts in the field of pre-training. In this reference, we will be discussing a technique called random corruption, which is used to train a model called ESM3.

First, let's define some terms. Pre-training is a technique used in machine learning where a model is trained on a large dataset before being fine-tuned on a smaller dataset for a specific task. ESM3 is a model that is used for pre-training.

Now, let's discuss the technique of random corruption. In this technique, we apply random corruption to the taxonomic lineages. Taxonomic lineages are a hierarchical classification system used to group organisms based on their evolutionary relationships.

To corrupt the taxonomic lineage, we either drop all terms with a probability of 25%, or we drop a set of the most specific terms of the lineage of size chosen uniformly at random from 1 to the length of the lineage with a probability of 25%. We also independently drop any taxonomic term with a probability of 10%.

After corrupting the taxonomic lineage, we train ESM3 to reconstruct the full lineage by predicting the dropped terms with a shallow MLP head trained on the final layer's representations. MLP stands for multi-layer perceptron, which is a type of neural network.

The output head outputs binary classification logits over the full set of 40,000 taxonomic lineage terms, and is trained to predict the missing terms via a binary-cross entropy loss. Binary classification logits are a type of output that is used in binary classification tasks, where the model is trained to predict whether an input belongs to one of two classes.

In summary, random corruption is a technique used in pre-training where we corrupt the taxonomic lineage by dropping terms and then train ESM3 to reconstruct the full lineage by predicting the dropped terms with a shallow MLP head. The output head outputs binary classification logits over the full set of taxonomic lineage terms and is trained to predict the missing terms via a binary-cross entropy loss.

ESM3 stands for Earth System Model 3, which is a complex computer model used to simulate the Earth's climate system. Inference, on the other hand, refers to the process of making conclusions or predictions based on available data.

ESM3 Inference, therefore, is the process of using the data generated by the ESM3 model to make predictions about the Earth's climate system.

To perform ESM3 Inference, scientists use a variety of statistical techniques to analyze the data generated by the ESM3 model. These techniques can include Bayesian inference, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, and other advanced statistical methods.

Overall, ESM3 Inference is a powerful tool for climate scientists and researchers, allowing them to make more accurate predictions about the Earth's climate system and better understand the complex interactions between different components of the system.

Since ESM3 is a bidirectional transformer capable of representing arbitrary factorizations of the joint probability in any order or combination of tracks, we have significant flexibility during inference: We can generate sequence, structure, or function conditioned on any or no combination of other tracks. We also have a choice of how much compute to apply during generation.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the concept of ESM3 and its implications for experts in the field.

ESM3 stands for "Efficient Structured Model 3" and it is a bidirectional transformer. A bidirectional transformer is a type of neural network that can process information in both directions, which means it can take into account both past and future information when making predictions.

The key feature of ESM3 is its ability to represent arbitrary factorizations of the joint probability in any order or combination of tracks. This means that it can take into account multiple factors when making predictions, which can lead to more accurate results.

During inference, ESM3 provides significant flexibility. It can generate sequence, structure, or function conditioned on any or no combination of other tracks. This means that it can be used to generate predictions based on a wide range of inputs, which can be useful in a variety of applications.

Another important feature of ESM3 is that it allows for a choice of how much compute to apply during generation. This means that it can be used in a variety of settings, from low-power devices to high-performance computing environments.

Overall, ESM3 is a powerful tool for experts in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Its ability to represent arbitrary factorizations of the joint probability and its flexibility during inference make it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications.

The usual inference strategy is to fix a prompt (which may be a combination of any of the tracks, either fully or partially specified) and choose a track for generation (which may have been partially specified). When predicting the tokens for the generation track, a number of strategies are possible. Two notable strategies Argmax decoding, which predicts all tokens in the generation track in a single forward pass of the model; this computation is $O\left(L^{2}\right)$ in the length of the protein and is extremely efficient. Iterative decoding, on the other hand, samples tokens one position at a time, conditioning subsequent predictions on those already sampled. The runtime for iterative decoding, comparable to slower algorithms such as ESMFold and AlphaFold, is $O\left(L^{3}\right)$ in the length of the protein.

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing the different inference strategies used in protein structure prediction.

In protein structure prediction, the goal is to predict the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. This is a complex task that requires sophisticated algorithms and computational resources.

One of the key steps in protein structure prediction is the inference process, which involves using a model to generate a prediction of the protein structure. There are several different inference strategies that can be used, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

The first strategy we will discuss is Argmax decoding. This strategy involves predicting all tokens in the generation track in a single forward pass of the model. This computation is $O\left(L^{2}\right)$ in the length of the protein, which means that it is extremely efficient.

The second strategy we will discuss is iterative decoding. This strategy involves sampling tokens one position at a time, conditioning subsequent predictions on those already sampled. The runtime for iterative decoding is $O\left(L^{3}\right)$ in the length of the protein, which is comparable to slower algorithms such as ESMFold and AlphaFold.

In both of these strategies, the prompt is fixed and the track for generation is chosen. The prompt can be a combination of any of the tracks, either fully or partially specified.

In summary, Argmax decoding is a fast and efficient inference strategy, while iterative decoding is slower but more accurate. The choice of inference strategy will depend on the specific needs of the protein structure prediction task at hand.

Thank you for watching this video, and we hope that you have gained a better understanding of the different inference strategies used in protein structure prediction.

Additionally, the number of decoding steps can be chosen at runtime. Argmax decoding is equivalent to decoding in one step, while iterative decoding is equivalent to decoding in $L$ steps. It is possible to select any number of decoding steps between these two extremes to find an optimal tradeoff between computation and accuracy for a particular use case. See Appendix A.3.4 for a case study in the case of structure prediction, in which the generation track is the structure tokens track.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on decoding steps in the field of natural language processing. In this video, we will be discussing the concept of decoding steps and how they can be used to optimize the tradeoff between computation and accuracy in various use cases.

First, let's define some terms that may not be obvious to those who are not familiar with this field. Decoding refers to the process of generating a sequence of tokens from a given input sequence. This is often done using a probabilistic model, such as a neural network, that assigns probabilities to each possible token given the input sequence.

The number of decoding steps refers to the number of times the model is run to generate the final sequence of tokens. For example, if we have an input sequence of length 10 and we want to generate a sequence of length 20, we may choose to run the model 2 times, each time generating 10 tokens. This would be equivalent to 2 decoding steps.

Argmax decoding is a type of decoding where the token with the highest probability is chosen at each step. This is equivalent to running the model only once, or 1 decoding step.

Iterative decoding, on the other hand, is a type of decoding where the model is run multiple times, each time using the previous output as input. This is equivalent to running the model $L$ times, where $L$ is the length of the output sequence.

Now, let's discuss how we can use the number of decoding steps to optimize the tradeoff between computation and accuracy. In general, running the model more times will result in a more accurate output, but will also require more computation. Conversely, running the model fewer times will result in a less accurate output, but will require less computation.

By selecting the number of decoding steps, we can find an optimal tradeoff between computation and accuracy for a particular use case. For example, if we are generating text for a chatbot, we may want to prioritize speed over accuracy, and choose a smaller number of decoding steps. On the other hand, if we are generating text for a scientific paper, we may want to prioritize accuracy over speed, and choose a larger number of decoding steps.

Finally, let's discuss a case study in the case of structure prediction, where the generation track is the structure tokens track. In this case, we can use the number of decoding steps to control the level of detail in the generated structure. By choosing a smaller number of decoding steps, we can generate a more general structure, while choosing a larger number of decoding steps will result in a more detailed structure.

In conclusion, the number of decoding steps is an important parameter in natural language processing that can be used to optimize the tradeoff between computation and accuracy in various use cases. By selecting the appropriate number of decoding steps, we can generate text that is both accurate and efficient. Thank you for watching!###

When using iterative decoding, ESM3 further allows flexibility in choosing the next position to decode. We choose the position based off of the logits output of ESM3, and for the results of this paper utilize two strategies: entropy decoding, which chooses the position with the lowest entropy after softmax, or max logit decoding, which chooses the position with the maximum logit. To generate $k$ tokens in one pass, we rank by either entropy or max logit and take the top $k$ positions.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video on iterative decoding and ESM3. In this video, we will be discussing the concept of iterative decoding and how ESM3 allows for flexibility in choosing the next position to decode.

Iterative decoding is a technique used in error-correcting codes to improve the accuracy of the decoding process. It involves repeatedly decoding the same message using different decoding algorithms until the desired level of accuracy is achieved.

ESM3, or the Enhanced Speech Model 3, is a deep learning model used for speech recognition. It is a neural network that is trained on large amounts of speech data to recognize and transcribe spoken words.

When using iterative decoding with ESM3, we have the flexibility to choose the next position to decode based on the logits output of ESM3. Logits are the raw output of the neural network before they are transformed into probabilities.

There are two strategies that we can use to choose the next position to decode: entropy decoding and max logit decoding.

Entropy decoding chooses the position with the lowest entropy after softmax. Entropy is a measure of the uncertainty or randomness of a system. Softmax is a function that converts the logits into probabilities.

Max logit decoding, on the other hand, chooses the position with the maximum logit. The logit with the highest value represents the most likely position to decode.

To generate $k$ tokens in one pass, we rank the positions based on either entropy or max logit and take the top $k$ positions.

In summary, iterative decoding with ESM3 allows for flexibility in choosing the next position to decode based on the logits output of the neural network. We can use entropy decoding or max logit decoding to choose the next position, and generate $k$ tokens in one pass by ranking the positions based on either entropy or max logit.

In the following algorithm, assume a single forward pass of ESM3 is a function $f$ of a prompt $x$, and that we can access the logits of a specific token track through a subscript; e.g. sequence logits would be $f_{\text {sequence }}(x) \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times 32}$. Furthermore, denote $\pi(\cdot ; z)$ as the probability distribution induced by the logits $z$, including an implicit softmax, and $T \in \mathbb{R}^{L}$ a temperature schedule.
------------------------------
 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing a reference to experts in the field of natural language processing. Specifically, we will be looking at an algorithm that utilizes a function called ESM3.

ESM3 stands for Enhanced Sparse Memory Model 3, which is a type of neural network architecture that is designed to process sequences of data. In this algorithm, we assume that a single forward pass of ESM3 is a function $f$ of a prompt $x$. This means that we can use the function $f$ to generate a set of logits, which are essentially numerical values that represent the probability of a particular outcome.

In this case, we are interested in the logits of a specific token track, which we can access through a subscript. For example, the sequence logits would be $f_{\text {sequence }}(x) \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times 32}$. This means that we have a matrix of logits, where each row represents a different token in the sequence, and each column represents a different feature of the token.

Once we have these logits, we can use them to generate a probability distribution using the function $\pi(\cdot ; z)$. This function takes in the logits $z$ and produces a probability distribution that represents the likelihood of each possible outcome. In this case, we are using an implicit softmax, which means that the probabilities are normalized so that they add up to 1.

Finally, we have a temperature schedule $T \in \mathbb{R}^{L}$, which is used to control the level of randomness in the probability distribution. A higher temperature means that the distribution is more spread out, while a lower temperature means that the distribution is more concentrated.

Overall, this algorithm is a powerful tool for processing sequences of data using neural networks, and it has many applications in natural language processing and other fields. Thank you for watching, and we hope you found this explanation helpful!###

 Hello and welcome to this video where we will be discussing Algorithm 14, which is used to generate from a track. This algorithm is commonly used in the field of music generation and is a part of the larger field of artificial intelligence.

Let's start by breaking down the inputs of the algorithm. The first input is $x_{\text {prompt }}$, which is the prompt that we will be using to generate the track. The second input is $n_{\text {decode }}$, which is the number of steps we will be decoding at each step. The third input is $T$, which is a matrix that represents the temperature of the system.

The next line of the algorithm is $k=L / n_{\text {decode }}$, which calculates the number of steps we will be taking to decode at each step. This is an important parameter as it determines the granularity of the generated track.

The algorithm then enters a loop where it iterates over each step of the decoding process. At each step, it calculates $z_{\text {logits }}$, which is a matrix that represents the logits of the system. This is done using the esm3_forward function, which is a function commonly used in music generation.

The algorithm then selects a set of positions using the CHOosePositions function. This function selects a set of positions based on the logits matrix and the temperature matrix.

Finally, the algorithm samples a new position using the pi function, which is a probability distribution function. This function takes in the logits matrix and the temperature matrix and outputs a new position.

The algorithm then updates the prompt with the new position and repeats the process until the desired number of steps have been taken.

In summary, Algorithm 14 is a commonly used algorithm in music generation that generates a track based on a prompt and a set of parameters. It uses a combination of matrix operations and probability distribution functions to generate a new track.
